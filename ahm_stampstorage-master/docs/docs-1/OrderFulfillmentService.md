# OrderFulfillmentService Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `OrderFulfillmentService` interface extends the `StampStorageService` interface and defines the contract for services responsible for fulfilling orders in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality to process and fulfill orders for carriers to various destinations.

## Logic/Functionality
- Extends the base `StampStorageService` interface
- Defines a `run()` method that executes the order fulfillment process
- Provides a `startFulfillment()` method to initiate the fulfillment process
- Includes a method to set the service role wrapper for active/passive mode control

## Flow
The OrderFulfillmentService is designed to:
1. Be executed periodically to check for orders that need fulfillment
2. Initiate the fulfillment process for eligible orders
3. Respect active/passive mode configuration to prevent duplicate operations
4. Coordinate the retrieval and delivery of carriers to fulfill orders

## Key Elements
- `run()`: The main method that executes the order fulfillment process
- `startFulfillment()`: Method to initiate the fulfillment process
- `setServiceRoleWrap()`: Method to set the service role (active/passive) wrapper

## Usage
This interface is implemented by services that:
- Process orders for carriers from various sources
- Coordinate the retrieval and delivery of carriers
- Manage the fulfillment lifecycle
- Update order status throughout the process
- It's typically scheduled to run at regular intervals via a scheduler

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. Orders not being fulfilled in a timely manner
2. Service running in passive mode when it should be active
3. Conflicts between multiple fulfillment operations
4. Incomplete fulfillment of orders
5. Errors during the fulfillment process

### Debugging Steps
1. Verify the service is running by checking logs for execution entries
2. Check if the service is in passive mode
3. Verify order configurations and eligibility criteria
4. Check for exceptions during the fulfillment process
5. Monitor order status transitions

### Resolution
- For timing issues: Check scheduling configuration and performance bottlenecks
- For passive mode issues: Verify ServiceRoleWrapper configuration
- For conflicts: Implement coordination between services
- For incomplete fulfillment: Check carrier availability and routing logic
- For errors: Analyze exceptions and fix underlying issues

### Monitoring
- Track order fulfillment times
- Monitor success rates for order fulfillment
- Set up alerts for orders that remain unfulfilled for extended periods
- Track service execution frequency
- Monitor for unusual patterns in order processing
