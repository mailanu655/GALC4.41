# Technical Documentation: order.roo

## Purpose
The `order.roo` file is a Spring Roo script file that contains a predefined sequence of commands for creating the domain model and web controllers for the StampStorageWeb module. Unlike the `log.roo` file which records commands as they are executed, this file is designed to be executed as a script to set up or recreate the application structure in a consistent manner.

## Logic
The file follows a structured sequence of Spring Roo commands that define:
- The project's base package
- Persistence configuration
- Domain model enumerations
- Entity definitions with their fields and relationships
- Web controller generation
- Test execution

The commands are organized in a logical order to ensure proper dependency resolution during execution, with base entities and enumerations defined before the entities that reference them.

## Flow
The `order.roo` file would be used during the following processes:
1. Initial project setup: To create the basic project structure and domain model.
2. Project recreation: To recreate the project structure if needed.
3. Development environment setup: To ensure consistent setup across development environments.

When executed, the script would run each command in sequence, creating the necessary Java classes, configuration files, and web controllers for the application.

## Key Elements
1. **Project Setup**:
   - `project --topLevelPackage com.honda.mfg.stamp.storage`: Defines the base package
   - `persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database DERBY`: Configures Hibernate with Derby

2. **Enumeration Definitions**:
   - OrderStatus: Queued, InProcess, Delivered, Completed, Cancelled, Paused
   - Side: Left_Side, Right_Side
   - StopType: NoAction, StoreIn, StoreInHighCapacity, StoreInMediumCapacity, StoreInLowCapacity, StoreOut
   - Press: PRESS_A_ROBOT_1, PRESS_A_ROBOT_2, PRESS_B_ROBOT_1, PRESS_B_ROBOT_2
   - CarrierStatus: Shippable, OnHoldStatus, InspectionRequired

3. **Entity Definitions**:
   - Die: Represents stamping dies with number and description
   - Model: Represents part models with name, description, side, and die reference
   - Item: Represents order items with quantity and model reference
   - WeldOrder: Represents welding orders with sequence, name, status, and items
   - OrderMgr: Represents order managers with line name and orders
   - ItemFulfillment: Tracks fulfilled quantities for items
   - Stop: Represents physical locations with name and type
   - AreaLookup: Maps names to stop locations
   - Carrier: Represents part carriers with number, quantity, locations, status, press, and timestamps

4. **Relationship Definitions**:
   - One-to-many: Die to Models, OrderMgr to WeldOrders, WeldOrder to Items
   - Many-to-one: Model to Die, Item to Model, Item to WeldOrder, WeldOrder to OrderMgr, Carrier to Die
   - One-to-one: ItemFulfillment to Item, AreaLookup to Stop, Carrier to current/destination Stop

5. **Controller Generation**:
   - `controller all --package ~.web`: Generates web controllers for all entities

6. **Test Execution**:
   - `perform tests`: Executes generated tests to verify the domain model

## Usage
This file is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Initial Project Creation**:
   - Running the script to set up a new instance of the StampStorageWeb module
   - Creating a consistent starting point for development

2. **Development Environment Setup**:
   - Ensuring all developers have the same base structure
   - Quickly setting up new development environments

3. **Project Recreation**:
   - Recreating the project structure if needed
   - Recovering from major structural issues

4. **Reference and Documentation**:
   - Understanding the intended domain model
   - Documenting entity relationships
   - Providing a clear view of the data model

5. **Training**:
   - Demonstrating Spring Roo capabilities
   - Teaching new developers about the project structure

**Note**: This file represents a clean, error-free version of the commands that were likely executed during the initial development (as recorded in `log.roo`). The structure reveals a manufacturing system focused on tracking stamped parts through carriers, with support for order management and fulfillment. The domain model suggests a system that manages the movement of carriers through different stops in a manufacturing process, with relationships to dies, models, and orders.
