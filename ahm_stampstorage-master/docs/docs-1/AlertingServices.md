# AlertingServices Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `AlertingServices` interface defines a simple contract for sending email notifications in the StampStorage system. It serves as an abstraction layer for email communication, allowing the system to notify personnel about various events, particularly alarms.

## Logic/Functionality
- Provides a single method `sendEmail()` for sending email notifications
- Takes an email address and message content as parameters
- Abstracts the underlying email sending mechanism from the rest of the system

## Flow
The AlertingServices is used in a straightforward manner:
1. A component that needs to send a notification (such as the AlarmServiceHelper) calls the `sendEmail()` method
2. It provides the recipient's email address and the message content
3. The implementation handles the details of connecting to the email server and sending the message

## Key Elements
- `sendEmail(String emailAddress, String message)`: The core method for sending email notifications

## Usage
This interface is used throughout the StampStorage system to:
- Send alarm notifications to contacts
- Potentially send pager notifications (by sending to pager email gateways)
- Notify personnel about system events
- It's typically injected into services that need to send notifications, particularly the AlarmServiceHelper

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. Email notifications not being delivered
2. Delays in email delivery
3. Formatting issues in email content
4. Connection problems with the email server
5. Authentication failures with the email server

### Debugging Steps
1. Verify email server configuration in the Spring context
2. Check for exceptions during email sending attempts
3. Verify recipient email address format
4. Test email server connectivity directly
5. Check email server logs for rejected messages

### Resolution
- For delivery failures: Verify email server configuration and connectivity
- For delivery delays: Check email server performance and queue settings
- For formatting issues: Review message content generation
- For connection problems: Verify network connectivity and server availability
- For authentication failures: Check credentials and authentication method

### Monitoring
- Track email sending success rates
- Monitor email server connectivity
- Set up alerts for repeated email sending failures
- Track email delivery times
- Monitor for unusual spikes in email volume
