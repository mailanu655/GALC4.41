# Technical Documentation: DeployToTomcat_pom.xml

## Purpose
The `DeployToTomcat_pom.xml` file is a Maven Project Object Model (POM) configuration specifically designed for deploying the StampStorageWeb module to Apache Tomcat. It defines the project metadata, dependencies, build configurations, and deployment settings required for building and deploying the web application to a Tomcat server.

## Logic
The file follows the standard Maven POM XML structure and defines:
- Project identification information (groupId, artifactId, version)
- Environment-specific profiles for different deployment targets
- Project properties including framework versions
- Repository configurations for dependency resolution
- Project dependencies for runtime and development
- Build plugins and their configurations for compilation, testing, and deployment

## Flow
The `DeployToTomcat_pom.xml` file is used during the following processes:
1. Dependency resolution: Maven uses the repository and dependency configurations to download required libraries.
2. Compilation: The build plugins compile the Java source code with the specified settings.
3. Testing: Test configurations determine how unit tests are executed.
4. Packaging: The project is packaged as a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.
5. Deployment: The Tomcat Maven plugin can deploy the WAR file to a Tomcat server.

This file works in conjunction with the standard `pom.xml` file, providing an alternative build configuration specifically optimized for Tomcat deployment.

## Key Elements
1. **Project Identification**:
   - `groupId`: com.honda.mfg.stamp.storage
   - `artifactId`: StampStorageUI
   - `version`: 1.0
   - `packaging`: war

2. **Environment Profiles**:
   - `development` (default): For development environment with testing enabled
   - `qa`: For quality assurance environment with testing enabled
   - `production`: For production environment with testing disabled

3. **Framework Versions**:
   - Spring: ${org.springframework.version}
   - AspectJ: 1.6.11
   - SLF4J: 1.6.1

4. **Repository Configurations**:
   - Spring Maven repositories
   - Spring Roo repository
   - JBoss repository

5. **Key Dependencies**:
   - Spring Framework components
   - Spring Security
   - Spring LDAP
   - Hibernate ORM
   - Apache Derby database
   - Logging frameworks
   - Web application libraries

6. **Build Plugins**:
   - Maven WAR plugin: For packaging the web application
   - Maven Compiler plugin: For compiling Java source code
   - AspectJ Maven plugin: For aspect-oriented programming support
   - Tomcat Maven plugin: For deploying to Tomcat server

7. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Tomcat server URL: http://LNXJAVA1P:8080/manager/text
   - Server ID: LNXJAVA1P_TOMCAT
   - Deployment path: /StampStorageUI

## Usage
This file is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Tomcat-Specific Deployment**:
   - When the application needs to be deployed to a Tomcat server instead of the default application server
   - For development or testing in a Tomcat environment
   - For production deployment to Tomcat servers

2. **Environment-Specific Builds**:
   - Development builds with debugging and testing enabled
   - QA builds with testing enabled
   - Production builds with testing disabled

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Resolving all required libraries for the web application
   - Managing transitive dependencies
   - Excluding conflicting dependencies

4. **Build Customization**:
   - Filtering resources based on environment
   - Configuring compiler options
   - Setting up AspectJ weaving
   - Configuring test execution

5. **Command-Line Deployment**:
   - Deploying to Tomcat using Maven command:
     ```
     mvn -f DeployToTomcat_pom.xml tomcat7:deploy -Denv=prod
     ```
   - Redeploying to Tomcat:
     ```
     mvn -f DeployToTomcat_pom.xml tomcat7:redeploy -Denv=dev
     ```

**Note**: The presence of this separate POM file suggests that the application is designed to be deployable to multiple server environments, with Tomcat being one of the supported deployment targets. The standard `pom.xml` likely contains configurations for the default application server (possibly WebSphere, given the IBM-specific dependencies in other files).
