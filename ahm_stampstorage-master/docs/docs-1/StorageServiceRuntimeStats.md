# StorageServiceRuntimeStats Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `StorageServiceRuntimeStats` class provides utility methods for gathering and reporting runtime statistics about the JVM environment in which the StampStorage service is running. It helps with monitoring system resources and diagnosing performance issues.

## Logic/Functionality
- Implemented as a final class with a private constructor to prevent instantiation
- Provides a static method to gather and format runtime statistics
- Collects information about memory usage and processor availability
- Formats the statistics into a human-readable string
- Serves as a utility for system monitoring and diagnostics

## Flow
1. The `getStatsAsString()` method is called to gather runtime statistics
2. It retrieves the Runtime instance to access JVM information
3. It collects statistics about:
   - Total memory allocated to the JVM
   - Maximum memory available to the JVM
   - Free memory currently available
   - Number of available processors
4. It formats these statistics into a readable string
5. The formatted string is returned for logging or display

## Key Elements
- `getStatsAsString()`: Static method that gathers and formats runtime statistics
- Private constructor to prevent instantiation
- Use of the Java Runtime class to gather system information
- StringBuilder for efficient string construction

## Usage
This utility class is used in the StampStorage system to:
- Log system resource information during startup
- Provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- Monitor resource usage during operation
- It's typically called from the `StorageServiceMain` class during startup

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. Inaccurate memory reporting due to garbage collection timing
2. Confusion between different memory metrics (total vs. max)
3. Missing or incomplete statistics
4. Formatting issues in the output string
5. Resource constraints not being detected

### Debugging Steps
1. Verify the output format of the statistics string
2. Check for consistency between reported values and actual system resources
3. Compare statistics with other monitoring tools
4. Verify that all expected statistics are being reported
5. Check for any exceptions during statistics gathering

### Resolution
- For inaccurate memory reporting: Consider forcing garbage collection before gathering statistics
- For metric confusion: Add clearer labels or documentation
- For missing statistics: Enhance the method to include additional metrics
- For formatting issues: Adjust the StringBuilder operations
- For detection issues: Add threshold checking and alerting

### Monitoring
- Track memory usage patterns over time
- Monitor for unusual changes in available resources
- Compare statistics with system monitoring tools
- Set up alerts for resource constraints
- Use statistics for capacity planning
