# StorageServiceMain Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `StorageServiceMain` class serves as the entry point for the StampStorage service application. It handles the initialization, startup, and shutdown of the Spring application context and manages the lifecycle of the service.

## Logic/Functionality
- Implements the `Runnable` interface to initialize the Spring application context
- Provides a `main()` method as the entry point for the application
- Handles command-line arguments to control service behavior (start/stop)
- Manages the Spring application context lifecycle
- Sets up shutdown hooks for graceful termination
- Initializes the server socket for client communication
- Logs runtime statistics and configuration information

## Flow
1. Application startup:
   - The `main()` method is called with command-line arguments
   - If the "start" argument is provided:
     - Runtime statistics are logged
     - A shutdown hook is registered
     - A new thread is started to initialize the Spring context
     - The application pauses to allow initialization
     - The server socket is retrieved and configured for the shutdown hook
   - If the "stop" argument is provided:
     - The server socket is closed
     - The Spring context is shut down

2. Spring context initialization (in the `run()` method):
   - The Spring application context is created with the applicationContext.xml configuration
   - Data source information is logged
   - A shutdown hook is registered for the context

## Key Elements
- `spring`: ExecutorService for managing the Spring context initialization thread
- `ctx`: Static reference to the ConfigurableApplicationContext
- `run()`: Method that initializes the Spring application context
- `main()`: Entry point that processes command-line arguments and controls application behavior
- Logging for monitoring and debugging
- Shutdown hook registration for graceful termination

## Usage
This class is used to:
- Start the StampStorage service application
- Stop the StampStorage service application
- Initialize the Spring application context
- Set up proper shutdown handling
- It's typically invoked from a command line or script with "start" or "stop" arguments

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. Spring context initialization failures
2. Data source connectivity issues
3. Server socket initialization problems
4. Shutdown hook not being executed properly
5. Command-line argument parsing errors

### Debugging Steps
1. Check logs for Spring context initialization messages
2. Verify data source configuration and connectivity
3. Check for server socket initialization messages
4. Monitor shutdown process for proper resource cleanup
5. Verify command-line arguments are being processed correctly

### Resolution
- For Spring context issues: Check applicationContext.xml configuration
- For data source issues: Verify database connectivity and configuration
- For server socket issues: Check network configuration and port availability
- For shutdown issues: Verify shutdown hook registration and execution
- For argument issues: Check command-line argument handling logic

### Monitoring
- Monitor logs for application startup and shutdown messages
- Track Spring context initialization time
- Monitor data source connectivity
- Set up alerts for initialization failures
- Track application uptime and restart patterns
