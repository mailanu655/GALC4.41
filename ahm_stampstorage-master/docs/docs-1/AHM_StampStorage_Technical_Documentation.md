# AHM Stamp Storage System Technical Documentation

## System Overview

The AHM Stamp Storage System is an enterprise-level application designed to manage and control the automated storage and retrieval of stamping dies and carriers in Honda's manufacturing facilities. The system integrates with Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), PLCs, and conveyor systems to orchestrate the movement and tracking of stamping materials.

## Core Components

### 1. Domain Layer (StampStorageDomain)

#### Key Entities:
- **Carrier**: Represents physical carriers that transport stamping dies
  - Tracks carrier number, quantity, location, status
  - Manages maintenance bits for carrier health monitoring
  - Integrates with die assignments and press operations

- **StorageRow**: Manages physical storage locations
  - Handles carrier positioning and lane management
  - Maintains storage area designations

- **Die**: Represents stamping dies
  - Contains die specifications and production parameters
  - Links to carrier assignments

### 2. Storage Management (StampStorageManager)

#### Core Interfaces:
- **Storage**: Primary interface for storage operations
  - Handles carrier storage and retrieval
  - Manages storage state calculations
  - Coordinates empty carrier management

#### Key Features:
- Dynamic destination calculation
- Storage state management
- Empty carrier retrieval logic
- Back-order processing

### 3. Database Structure

#### Primary Tables:
- **CARRIER_TBX**: Main carrier tracking table
  - Carrier identification
  - Current status and location
  - Maintenance information

- **StampingStatus**: Tracks carrier movement
  - Current and requested destinations
  - Timestamp tracking
  - Movement history

- **CarrierInfo**: Detailed carrier information
  - Die assignments
  - Quantity tracking
  - Model information
