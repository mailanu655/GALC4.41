# Technical Documentation: pom.xml

## Purpose
The `pom.xml` file is the Maven Project Object Model configuration for the StampStorageWeb module. It defines the project's metadata, dependencies, build configurations, and deployment settings required for building and running the web application. This is the primary build configuration file that controls how the application is compiled, tested, packaged, and deployed.

## Logic
The file follows the standard Maven POM XML structure and defines:
- Project identification information (groupId, artifactId, version)
- Environment-specific profiles for different deployment targets
- Project properties including framework versions
- Repository configurations for dependency resolution
- Project dependencies for runtime and development
- Build plugins and their configurations for compilation, testing, and deployment

The file is structured to support multiple environments (development, QA, production) with environment-specific properties and configurations.

## Flow
The `pom.xml` file is used during the following processes:
1. Dependency resolution: Maven uses the repository and dependency configurations to download required libraries.
2. Compilation: The build plugins compile the Java source code with the specified settings.
3. Testing: Test configurations determine how unit tests are executed.
4. Packaging: The project is packaged as a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.
5. Deployment: The configured plugins can deploy the WAR file to a server.

This file is the central configuration that drives the entire build and deployment process for the StampStorageWeb module.

## Key Elements
1. **Project Identification**:
   - `groupId`: com.honda.mfg.stamp.storage
   - `artifactId`: StampStorageUI
   - `version`: 1.0
   - `packaging`: war

2. **Environment Profiles**:
   - `alwaysactive`: Default profile that sets environment to dev
   - `development`: For development environment with testing enabled
   - `qa`: For quality assurance environment with testing enabled
   - `production`: For production environment with testing disabled

3. **Framework Versions**:
   - Spring: 4.3.30.RELEASE (updated from earlier versions)
   - AspectJ: 1.9.19 (updated from earlier versions)
   - SLF4J: 1.6.1

4. **Repository Configurations**:
   - Artifactory repositories (central, snapshots)
   - JBoss repository

5. **Key Dependencies**:
   - Spring Framework components (core, test, context, aop, aspects, tx, web, webmvc)
   - Spring Security (core, config, taglibs, ldap)
   - Spring LDAP
   - Hibernate ORM
   - Apache Derby database
   - Log4j2 logging framework
   - Web application libraries (servlet-api, jstl, etc.)
   - StampStorageDomain and ConnectionDevice modules

6. **Build Plugins**:
   - Maven WAR plugin: For packaging the web application
   - Maven Compiler plugin: For compiling Java source code
   - Maven Resources plugin: For handling resource files
   - Maven Surefire plugin: For running tests
   - Tomcat7 Maven plugin: For deploying to Tomcat server
   - Jetty Maven plugin: For running the application locally

7. **Resource Filtering**:
   - Environment-specific properties files in `../filters/${env}.properties`
   - Resource filtering for main resources and web resources

## Usage
This file is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Project Building**:
   - Compiling the source code: `mvn compile`
   - Running tests: `mvn test`
   - Packaging the application: `mvn package`
   - Installing to local repository: `mvn install`

2. **Environment-Specific Builds**:
   - Development builds: `mvn package -Denv=dev`
   - QA builds: `mvn package -Denv=qa`
   - Production builds: `mvn package -Denv=prod`

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Resolving all required libraries for the web application
   - Managing transitive dependencies
   - Excluding conflicting dependencies

4. **Local Development**:
   - Running the application locally with Jetty: `mvn jetty:run`
   - Running the application locally with Tomcat: `mvn tomcat7:run`

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploying to Tomcat: `mvn tomcat7:deploy`
   - Redeploying to Tomcat: `mvn tomcat7:redeploy`

**Note**: This POM file shows evidence of modernization efforts, with updated dependency versions compared to the original project (e.g., Spring 4.3.30.RELEASE instead of an older version, Log4j2 instead of Log4j 1.x). The repository configuration points to Honda's Artifactory servers, indicating an enterprise-managed dependency system. The file also shows a shift from IBM WebSphere (as suggested by other configuration files) to also support Tomcat deployment, providing more deployment flexibility.
