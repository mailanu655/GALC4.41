# AlertingServiceImpl Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `AlertingServiceImpl` class implements the `AlertingServices` interface and provides the concrete implementation for sending email notifications in the StampStorage system. It leverages Spring's email support to send notifications to personnel about various events, particularly alarms.

## Logic/Functionality
- Implements the `sendEmail()` method using Spring's `JavaMailSender` and `SimpleMailMessage`
- Configures email messages with recipient, content, and subject
- Adds environment information to the subject line for clarity
- Handles exceptions during the email sending process
- Maintains a simple interface while leveraging Spring's robust email capabilities

## Flow
1. When `sendEmail()` is called, it creates a new `SimpleMailMessage` based on a template
2. It sets the recipient's email address and message content
3. It appends the environment name to the subject line for context
4. It attempts to send the email using the configured `JavaMailSender`
5. It catches and logs any exceptions that occur during sending

## Key Elements
- `mailSender`: Spring's JavaMailSender for handling email transmission
- `simpleMailMessage`: Template for email messages with default settings
- `env`: Environment name (e.g., "DEV", "QA", "PROD") to include in the subject
- Exception handling to prevent email failures from disrupting the application

## Usage
This implementation is used throughout the StampStorage system to:
- Send alarm notifications to contacts
- Send pager notifications (via email gateways)
- Notify personnel about system events
- It's typically injected into services that need to send notifications, particularly the AlarmServiceHelper

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. Email notifications not being delivered
2. Exceptions during email sending
3. Missing or incorrect environment information in subject
4. Configuration issues with the mail server
5. Authentication failures with the email server

### Debugging Steps
1. Check for `MailSendException` stack traces in the logs
2. Verify mail server configuration in the Spring context:
   - Host, port, username, password
   - SSL/TLS settings
   - Authentication requirements
3. Check the template message configuration
4. Verify that the environment name is correctly set
5. Test email server connectivity directly

### Resolution
- For delivery failures: Verify email server configuration and connectivity
- For exceptions: Analyze stack traces and fix underlying issues
- For subject line issues: Check environment name configuration
- For configuration issues: Review Spring mail configuration
- For authentication failures: Verify credentials and authentication method

### Monitoring
- Track email sending attempts and failures
- Monitor for `MailSendException` occurrences
- Set up alerts for repeated email sending failures
- Periodically verify email server connectivity
- Monitor for changes in email server configuration that might affect sending
