# AHM Stamp Storage System - Executive Summary

## Overview

The AHM Stamp Storage system is a critical manufacturing process management application designed for Honda's automotive manufacturing facilities. It manages and optimizes the flow of stamped parts carriers through an overhead conveyor system, ensuring efficient storage utilization and just-in-time delivery to welding lines. This document provides a high-level summary of the complete system analysis.

## Core Business Purpose

The AHM Stamp Storage system solves several key business challenges in the automotive stamping process:

1. **Efficient Storage Management**: The system optimizes the use of limited overhead conveyor storage space for carriers containing stamped automotive parts.

2. **Production Synchronization**: It ensures that the right stamped parts are delivered to welding lines exactly when needed, supporting just-in-time manufacturing principles.

3. **Automated Decision Making**: The system automatically determines optimal storage locations and retrieval sequences, reducing manual decision-making and potential errors.

4. **Manufacturing Flow Optimization**: By managing the movement of carriers throughout the facility, the system minimizes bottlenecks and maximizes throughput.

5. **Inventory Visibility**: It provides real-time visibility into the location and contents of all carriers in the storage system.
