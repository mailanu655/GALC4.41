# OrderFulfillmentServiceImpl Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `OrderFulfillmentServiceImpl` class implements the `OrderFulfillmentService` interface and provides the concrete implementation for fulfilling orders in the StampStorage system. It coordinates the process of retrieving and delivering carriers to fulfill customer orders.

## Logic/Functionality
- Implements the `OrderFulfillmentService` interface and the `Runnable` interface
- Uses a `Fulfillment` object to handle the actual fulfillment logic
- Respects active/passive mode configuration via ServiceRoleWrapper
- Provides a simple implementation that delegates most functionality to the Fulfillment object
- Logs information about the fulfillment process

## Flow
1. When `run()` is called, it first checks if the service is in passive mode
2. If active, it calls the `startFulfillment()` method
3. The `startFulfillment()` method logs information about the customer and delegates to the Fulfillment object
4. The Fulfillment object handles the details of carrier retrieval and delivery

## Key Elements
- `fulfillment`: The object that handles the actual fulfillment logic
- `serviceRoleWrap`: Determines if the service is in active or passive mode
- `run()`: Main method that checks mode and initiates fulfillment if active
- `startFulfillment()`: Method that logs information and delegates to the Fulfillment object

## Usage
This implementation is used in production environments to:
- Process orders for carriers from various customers
- Coordinate the retrieval and delivery of carriers
- Manage the fulfillment lifecycle
- Update order status throughout the process
- It's typically scheduled to run at regular intervals via a scheduler

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. Orders not being fulfilled due to passive mode
2. Exceptions during the fulfillment process
3. Fulfillment not starting despite active mode
4. Logging issues obscuring fulfillment activity
5. Configuration issues with the Fulfillment object

### Debugging Steps
1. Check logs for fulfillment activity with the message "Running fulfillment/delivery cycle for customer"
2. Verify the service is not in passive mode by checking if `serviceRoleWrap.isPassive()` returns false
3. Check for exceptions during the fulfillment process
4. Verify the Fulfillment object is properly configured
5. Check that the OrderFulfillmentServiceImpl is being scheduled correctly

### Resolution
- For passive mode issues: Verify ServiceRoleWrapper configuration
- For exceptions: Analyze stack traces and fix underlying issues
- For fulfillment not starting: Check scheduling and mode configuration
- For logging issues: Verify logging configuration
- For Fulfillment configuration: Check Spring context configuration

### Monitoring
- Track fulfillment attempts by monitoring logs
- Monitor success rates for order fulfillment
- Set up alerts for repeated exceptions
- Track service execution frequency
- Monitor for unusual patterns in fulfillment activity
