# ReleaseEmptyCarriersService Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `ReleaseEmptyCarriersService` interface defines the contract for services responsible for releasing empty carriers from one area to another in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality to ensure that empty carriers are moved to areas where they are needed.

## Logic/Functionality
- Defines a `run()` method that executes the empty carrier release process
- Provides a method to set the service role wrapper for active/passive mode control
- Serves as a contract for implementations that handle releasing empty carriers

## Flow
The ReleaseEmptyCarriersService is designed to be executed periodically to:
1. Check if specific areas need empty carriers
2. Release empty carriers from source areas to destination areas
3. Respect active/passive mode configuration to prevent duplicate operations

## Key Elements
- `run()`: The main method that executes the empty carrier release process
- `setServiceRoleWrapper()`: Method to set the service role (active/passive) wrapper

## Usage
This interface is implemented by services that:
- Monitor empty carrier levels in specific areas
- Release empty carriers from one area to another when needed
- Maintain appropriate carrier distribution throughout the system
- It's typically scheduled to run at regular intervals via a scheduler

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. Empty carriers not being released when needed
2. Service running in passive mode when it should be active
3. Conflicts between multiple release services
4. Configuration issues with thresholds and counts
5. Performance issues during high activity periods

### Debugging Steps
1. Verify the service is running by checking logs for execution entries
2. Check if the service is in passive mode
3. Verify threshold configurations for determining when to release carriers
4. Check carrier count configurations for release operations
5. Monitor for conflicts with other carrier movement operations

### Resolution
- For release issues: Check threshold configurations and release logic
- For passive mode issues: Verify ServiceRoleWrapper configuration
- For conflicts: Implement coordination between services
- For configuration issues: Verify parameter values in the database
- For performance issues: Optimize operations and consider scheduling adjustments

### Monitoring
- Track empty carrier levels in different areas
- Monitor carrier release operations
- Set up alerts for areas consistently below thresholds
- Track service execution frequency
- Monitor for unusual patterns in carrier distribution
