# database.properties Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The database.properties file defines the database connection parameters for the StampStorage application. It contains the configuration needed to establish connections to the database, including connection URLs, credentials, and connection pool settings. This file is crucial for the application's data persistence layer and enables the application to interact with the database across different environments.

## Logic/Configuration
The file contains key-value pairs that define:

1. **Database Connection Parameters**: URL, driver class, username, and password
2. **Connection Pool Settings**: Initial size, maximum size, and validation query
3. **Hibernate Configuration**: Dialect, show SQL flag, and other Hibernate-specific settings
4. **Environment-Specific Properties**: Different settings for development, testing, and production

The file uses property placeholders (${filter.xxx}) for sensitive or environment-specific values, allowing these values to be injected during the build process. This enables deployment to different environments without code changes.

## Flow
1. During application startup, Spring loads this properties file
2. The property values are used to configure the database connection factory
3. The connection factory creates and manages database connections
4. Hibernate uses these connections for database operations
5. The application uses the configured persistence layer for data access

## Key Elements
- **Database URL** (line 2): The JDBC URL for connecting to the database
- **Driver Class** (line 3): The JDBC driver class for the database
- **Username** (line 4): The database username
- **Password** (line 5): The database password
- **Connection Pool Settings** (lines 7-10): Configuration for the connection pool
- **Hibernate Settings** (lines 12-15): Configuration for Hibernate ORM

## Usage
This file is used:
- During application startup to configure database connectivity
- When deploying to different environments (development, testing, production)
- When troubleshooting database connection issues
- When tuning database performance
- When changing database credentials or connection parameters

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Failures**: Unable to connect to the database
2. **Authentication Problems**: Invalid credentials
3. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Running out of database connections
4. **Performance Issues**: Slow queries or connection establishment
5. **Property Resolution Failures**: Filter properties not being resolved correctly

### Debugging Steps
1. **Connection Failures**:
   - Verify database URL is correct and the database server is running
   - Check network connectivity between application and database
   - Review application logs for connection error messages
   - Test connectivity using database client tools
   - Verify driver class is correct and available in the classpath

2. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Verify username and password are correct
   - Check database user permissions
   - Review application logs for authentication failures
   - Test authentication using database client tools
   - Verify credentials are properly resolved from filter properties

3. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**:
   - Check connection pool settings (initial size, max size)
   - Monitor active connections during peak load
   - Look for connection leaks in application code
   - Review application logs for connection pool warnings
   - Test with increased pool size to verify issue

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Review connection pool settings for optimal performance
   - Check validation query for efficiency
   - Monitor database performance metrics
   - Look for slow queries in application logs
   - Test with different connection pool configurations

5. **Property Resolution Failures**:
   - Check filter files for the correct property definitions
   - Verify the build process is correctly applying filters
   - Look for unresolved ${filter.xxx} values in the deployed properties file
   - Review application logs for property resolution errors
   - Test with hardcoded values to isolate filter issues

### Resolution
1. **Connection Failures**:
   - Update database URL with correct server and database name
   - Resolve network connectivity issues
   - Ensure database server is running and accessible
   - Update driver class if needed
   - Implement connection retry logic

2. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Update username and password with correct values
   - Grant necessary permissions to database user
   - Implement secure credential storage
   - Add detailed logging for authentication process
   - Consider using a connection proxy for debugging

3. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**:
   - Increase maximum pool size based on application needs
   - Fix connection leaks in application code
   - Implement connection timeout and validation
   - Add connection pool monitoring
   - Consider using a more robust connection pool implementation

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Optimize connection pool settings
   - Use an efficient validation query
   - Implement connection pre-warming
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Consider database-specific optimizations

5. **Property Resolution Failures**:
   - Update filter files with correct property values
   - Fix the build process to properly apply filters
   - Add validation for critical properties during startup
   - Implement default values for missing properties
   - Add detailed logging for property resolution

### Monitoring
1. **Connection Status**: Monitor database connection success and failures
2. **Connection Pool**: Track active, idle, and total connections
3. **Query Performance**: Monitor query execution times
4. **Authentication**: Track authentication successes and failures
5. **Resource Usage**: Monitor database server resource utilization
6. **Connection Leaks**: Track connection acquisition and release patterns
7. **Property Values**: Validate property resolution during startup

## Additional Notes
The file contains sensitive database credentials (line 5) in the form of property placeholders. In a production environment, these credentials should be securely managed and not stored in plain text.

The connection pool settings (lines 7-10) are critical for application performance and stability. Insufficient pool size can lead to connection wait times and degraded performance, while excessive pool size can waste resources and potentially overload the database server.

The Hibernate settings (lines 12-15) control how the ORM layer interacts with the database. The hibernate.show_sql property (line 13) should be set to false in production to avoid excessive logging, but can be useful for debugging in development environments.

The use of property placeholders (${filter.xxx}) allows for environment-specific configuration without code changes. This is important for maintaining consistent application code across different deployment environments while adapting the database connection parameters to each environment's specific requirements.
