# storage-service.xml Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The storage-service.xml file defines the core service components for the StampStorage application's carrier management and device communication functionality. It configures the service beans responsible for managing carriers, processing orders, communicating with external devices, and maintaining the storage state. This file is essential for the application's business logic and integration with physical systems.

## Logic/Configuration
The file configures several key service components:

1. **Carrier Management Service**: Handles carrier tracking, movement, and status
2. **Order Management Service**: Processes orders and fulfillment requests
3. **Device Communication**: Configures communication with MES and PLC devices
4. **Storage State Management**: Maintains the state of storage rows and carriers
5. **Service Proxies**: Provides remote access to services
6. **Event Handling**: Configures event processing for carrier movements

These components work together to create a cohesive service layer that implements the core business logic of the StampStorage application.

## Flow
1. During application startup, Spring loads this configuration file
2. The service beans are instantiated and wired together
3. Device communication components are initialized
4. Storage state is loaded or initialized
5. Event handlers are registered
6. The service layer becomes ready to process requests from controllers

## Key Elements
- **Carrier Management Service** (lines 10-15): Configures the carrier management service
- **Order Management Service** (lines 17-22): Configures the order processing service
- **Device Communication** (lines 24-30): Sets up communication with external devices
- **Storage State Management** (lines 32-38): Configures storage state tracking
- **Service Proxies** (lines 40-45): Defines service proxies for remote access
- **Event Handling** (lines 47-52): Configures event processing components

## Usage
This file is used:
- During application startup to initialize the service layer
- When modifying carrier management logic
- When updating order processing behavior
- When changing device communication parameters
- When troubleshooting service-related issues
- When extending the service layer with new functionality

## Debugging and Production Support

## Additional Notes
The storage-service.xml file is a critical component of the StampStorage application, as it defines the core business logic and integration with physical systems. Changes to this file should be carefully tested, as they can affect the entire application's behavior.

The file imports either mes-device.xml or mes-device-mock.xml (line 5), depending on the deployment environment. This allows for different device configurations in production (real devices) and development/testing (mock devices) environments.

The carrier management service (lines 10-15) is the central component for tracking and managing carriers. It maintains the current state of all carriers in the system and coordinates their movement and status updates.

The order management service (lines 17-22) processes orders from welding lines and coordinates the fulfillment of these orders by selecting and delivering appropriate carriers.

The device communication components (lines 24-30) handle the interaction with external systems, such as MES and PLC devices. These components translate between the application's internal data model and the external systems' protocols and data formats.

The event handling configuration (lines 47-52) sets up the event processing system that enables loose coupling between components. Events are used to notify interested components about carrier movements, status changes, and other significant occurrences in the system.
