# SocketConnectionConstantsInterface

## Purpose
The SocketConnectionConstantsInterface defines constants used for socket connection configuration in the StampStorage system. It centralizes all socket-related configuration parameters and their default values, providing a single source of truth for socket connection settings across the application.

## Logic/Functionality
- Defines default values for socket connection parameters
- Provides string constants for property keys used in configuration files
- Establishes standard naming conventions for socket configuration properties
- Ensures consistency in socket connection settings across the application

## Flow
1. Socket server and connection classes implement this interface to access the constants
2. Configuration properties are loaded from property files using the defined property keys
3. If specific properties are not found in the configuration, the default values are used
4. These constants are used throughout the socket connection lifecycle

## Key Elements
- **Default Values**: Constants like DEFAULT_MAX_CONNECTIONS, DEFAULT_MAX_NUM_TIMEOUTS, and DEFAULT_PORT
- **Property Keys**: String constants for configuration properties like SERVER_PORT_PROPERTY_KEY and SOCKET_TIMEOUT_PROPERTY_KEY
- **Timeout Settings**: Various timeout-related constants for managing socket connection timeouts
- **Connection Limits**: Constants for limiting the number of connections and retries

## Usage
The interface is implemented by socket-related classes to access the constants:

```java
// Example of a class implementing the interface
public class StampServiceServerSocket implements Runnable, StampServiceServerSocketInterface, ServiceRoleObserver {
    // Can directly use constants like DEFAULT_MAX_CONNECTIONS
    private int maxNumConnections_ = DEFAULT_MAX_CONNECTIONS;
}
```

Configuration properties are loaded using the constant keys:

```java
// Example of loading properties using the constant keys
serverPort = Integer.valueOf(props.getProperty(SERVER_PORT_PROPERTY_KEY, String.valueOf(DEFAULT_PORT))).intValue();
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Misconfigured Socket Properties**: Incorrect values in configuration files can lead to connection issues
2. **Timeout Problems**: Inappropriate timeout settings can cause premature connection termination or hanging connections
3. **Connection Limits**: Setting connection limits too low can prevent legitimate connections
4. **Port Conflicts**: The default port might conflict with other services on the same machine

### Debugging Steps
1. **Check Configuration Files**: Verify that socket properties in configuration files match expected values
2. **Review Timeout Settings**: Ensure timeout settings are appropriate for the network environment
3. **Monitor Connection Counts**: Track the number of active connections to ensure they stay within limits
4. **Port Availability**: Confirm that the configured port is available and not blocked by firewalls

### Resolution
1. **Configuration Updates**: Adjust configuration properties to match the operational environment
2. **Timeout Tuning**: Fine-tune timeout settings based on network performance and reliability
3. **Connection Limit Adjustments**: Increase connection limits if legitimate connections are being rejected
4. **Port Changes**: Change the port if conflicts with other services are detected

### Monitoring
1. **Connection Statistics**: Track connection success rates and durations
2. **Timeout Occurrences**: Monitor how often connections time out
3. **Resource Usage**: Watch for resource consumption related to socket connections
4. **Configuration Changes**: Log and audit changes to socket configuration properties
