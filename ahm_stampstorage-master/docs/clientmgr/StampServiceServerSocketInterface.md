# StampServiceServerSocketInterface

## Purpose
The StampServiceServerSocketInterface defines the contract for server socket implementations in the StampStorage system. It establishes a standardized interface for server socket functionality, enabling loose coupling between the server socket implementation and the components that use it. This interface extends SocketConnectionConstantsInterface to inherit socket connection constants.

## Logic/Functionality
- Extends SocketConnectionConstantsInterface to inherit socket connection constants
- Defines methods for controlling the server socket lifecycle
- Provides methods for querying server socket state
- Establishes a contract for server socket implementations to follow

## Flow
1. Implementing classes initialize the server socket with configuration parameters
2. The server socket is started to begin accepting client connections
3. The server socket can be queried for its current state (e.g., number of connections)
4. When no longer needed, the server socket can be closed
5. The service role wrapper can be set to enable role-based operation

## Key Elements
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Methods like init(), start(), and closeSocket() for controlling the server socket lifecycle
- **State Query Methods**: Methods like isDone() and getNumConnections() for querying server socket state
- **Role Management**: The setServiceRoleWrapper() method for setting the service role wrapper
- **SocketConnectionConstantsInterface Extension**: Inherits socket connection constants from SocketConnectionConstantsInterface

## Usage
The interface is implemented by server socket classes and used by components that need to control server sockets:

```java
// Example of a class implementing the interface
public class StampServiceServerSocket implements Runnable, StampServiceServerSocketInterface, ServiceRoleObserver {
    // Implementation details
}
```

Client code can use the interface to control server sockets without depending on specific implementations:

```java
// Example of using the interface
StampServiceServerSocketInterface serverSocket = new StampServiceServerSocket(configFileName);
serverSocket.init();
serverSocket.start();
// Later
if (serverSocket.getNumConnections() > maxConnections) {
    serverSocket.closeSocket();
}
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Implementation Inconsistencies**: Different implementations might behave differently despite implementing the same interface
2. **Incomplete Implementations**: Implementations might not fully adhere to the interface contract
3. **Interface Evolution**: As the system evolves, the interface may need to be updated to include new methods
4. **Missing Method Implementations**: Required methods might be missing or incompletely implemented

### Debugging Steps
1. **Review Interface Contract**: Ensure the interface defines all necessary methods for server socket operation
2. **Check Implementations**: Verify that all implementations correctly fulfill the interface contract
3. **Test Interface Methods**: Test each method defined in the interface to ensure it behaves as expected
4. **Examine Usage Patterns**: Review how the interface is used throughout the codebase

### Resolution
1. **Interface Updates**: Add new methods to the interface as needed, with careful consideration for backward compatibility
2. **Implementation Standardization**: Ensure all implementations follow consistent patterns and behaviors
3. **Documentation Improvements**: Enhance documentation to clarify the expected behavior of each method
4. **Compliance Testing**: Develop tests to verify that implementations comply with the interface contract

### Monitoring
1. **Interface Usage**: Monitor how and where the interface is used in the codebase
2. **Implementation Performance**: Compare the performance of different implementations
3. **Method Call Patterns**: Track which methods are called most frequently and in what contexts
4. **Error Patterns**: Monitor for errors or exceptions related to interface method calls
