# ServiceRole Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `ServiceRole` class represents a role configuration for an external service in the StampStorage system. It encapsulates information about service endpoints, including IP address and port, and provides methods to access and manipulate this information. This class is essential for establishing connections to external systems such as MES (Manufacturing Execution System) or PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) devices.

## Logic/Functionality
The `ServiceRole` class provides several key functionalities:

1. **Endpoint Information Storage**: Stores IP address and port information for service endpoints
2. **Endpoint Information Access**: Provides methods to access endpoint information
3. **Endpoint Information Validation**: Validates endpoint information for correctness
4. **Endpoint Information Comparison**: Compares endpoint information for equality
5. **String Representation**: Provides string representation of endpoint information

## Flow
The `ServiceRole` is typically used in the following workflow:

1. The class is instantiated with IP address and port information
2. The instance is stored in the `ServiceConnectionManager` for later use
3. Other components retrieve the service role to establish connections to external systems
4. The service role information is used to create socket connections or other communication channels
5. The service role may be updated if the endpoint information changes

## Key Elements
- **IP Address**: The IP address of the service endpoint
- **Port**: The port number of the service endpoint
- **getIp/setIp**: Methods to access and modify the IP address
- **getPort/setPort**: Methods to access and modify the port number
- **equals/hashCode**: Methods to compare service roles for equality
- **toString**: Method to provide a string representation of the service role

## Usage
The `ServiceRole` is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Service Connection Management**: When managing connections to external services
   ```java
   ServiceRole role = new ServiceRole();
   role.setIp("192.168.1.100");
   role.setPort(8080);
   serviceConnectionManager.setServiceRole(role);
   ```

2. **Connection Establishment**: When establishing connections to external systems
   ```java
   ServiceRole role = serviceConnectionManager.getServiceRole();
   Socket socket = new Socket(role.getIp(), role.getPort());
   ```

3. **Service Role Comparison**: When comparing service roles for equality
   ```java
   ServiceRole role1 = serviceConnectionManager.getServiceRole();
   ServiceRole role2 = new ServiceRole("192.168.1.100", 8080);
   boolean equal = role1.equals(role2);
   ```

4. **Service Role Display**: When displaying service role information
   ```java
   ServiceRole role = serviceConnectionManager.getServiceRole();
   String roleInfo = role.toString();
   ```

## Database Tables
The `ServiceRole` class does not directly interact with database tables. However, service role information may be stored in configuration files or system properties.

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Invalid IP Address**: IP address not properly formatted or invalid
2. **Invalid Port Number**: Port number out of range or invalid
3. **Null Service Role**: Service role not properly initialized
4. **Service Role Mismatch**: Service role not matching expected configuration
5. **Service Role Update Failures**: Failures when updating service role information

### Debugging Steps
1. **Invalid IP Address**:
   - Check the IP address format
   - Verify the IP address is valid
   - Check for IP address validation logic
   - Review logs for IP address errors
   - Test with known valid IP addresses

2. **Invalid Port Number**:
   - Check the port number range
   - Verify the port number is valid
   - Check for port number validation logic
   - Review logs for port number errors
   - Test with known valid port numbers

3. **Null Service Role**:
   - Check the service role initialization
   - Verify the service role is not null
   - Check for null checks in code using service roles
   - Review logs for null service role errors
   - Test with properly initialized service roles

4. **Service Role Mismatch**:
   - Check the expected service role configuration
   - Verify the actual service role configuration
   - Check for service role comparison logic
   - Review logs for service role mismatch errors
   - Test with matching service role configurations

5. **Service Role Update Failures**:
   - Check the service role update logic
   - Verify the service role update permissions
   - Check for service role update validation
   - Review logs for service role update errors
   - Test with controlled service role updates
