# CarrierManagementService Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `CarrierManagementService` interface defines the core service contract for managing carriers in the StampStorage system. It serves as the primary interface for carrier tracking, movement, and status management operations. This interface abstracts the business logic related to carrier management, allowing for different implementations while maintaining a consistent API for client code.

## Logic/Functionality
The interface defines several key methods for carrier management:

1. **Carrier Position Management**: Methods to determine and manage carrier positions within storage lanes
2. **Destination Management**: Methods to identify valid destinations for carriers
3. **Storage State Management**: Methods to reload and manage the storage state
4. **Carrier Information Retrieval**: Methods to get carrier information and convert between domain models
5. **Group Hold Management**: Methods to retrieve carriers based on group hold criteria
6. **Alarm Management**: Methods to retrieve alarm events for display
7. **Order Fulfillment**: Methods to retrieve order fulfillment information
8. **Maintenance Bit Management**: Methods to set and manage maintenance bits
9. **Connection State Management**: Methods to check connection status

## Flow
The `CarrierManagementService` interface is typically used in the following workflow:

1. Controllers or other service components inject the `CarrierManagementService` implementation
2. The service is used to retrieve carrier information, manage carrier positions, and handle carrier movements
3. The service interacts with the database through domain objects and repositories
4. The service may communicate with external systems (like MES or PLC devices) through other services
5. The service provides status information about carriers and the system to the UI layer

## Key Elements
- **getPositionInLane**: Determines the position of a carrier within a storage lane
- **getManualOrderCarrierDeliveryStops**: Retrieves stops that can be used for manual carrier delivery
- **getValidDestinationStops**: Identifies valid destinations for carriers from a given stop
- **reloadStorageState**: Refreshes the storage state from the database
- **getCarrier**: Converts a CarrierMes object to a Carrier domain object
- **getGroupHoldCarriers**: Retrieves carriers based on group hold criteria
- **getAlarmEventToDisplay**: Gets alarm events that should be displayed to users
- **getOrderFulfillmentsByOrder**: Retrieves order fulfillment information for a given order
- **setBitInfo**: Configures maintenance bit information
- **isDisconnected/isConnected**: Checks the connection status to external systems

## Usage
The `CarrierManagementService` is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Web Controllers**: Controllers inject the service to retrieve carrier information for display
   ```java
   @Autowired
   private CarrierManagementService carrierManagementService;
   
   @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
   public String list(Model uiModel) {
       boolean mesHealthy = !carrierManagementService.isDisconnected();
       uiModel.addAttribute("meshealthy", mesHealthy);
       return "carriers/list";
   }
   ```

2. **Lane Management**: When managing carrier positions in storage lanes
   ```java
   Integer position = carrierManagementService.getPositionInLane(laneId, carrierNumber);
   ```

3. **Destination Management**: When determining valid destinations for carriers
   ```java
   List<Stop> validDestinations = carrierManagementService.getValidDestinationStops(currentStop);
   ```

4. **Carrier Information Retrieval**: When converting between domain models
   ```java
   Carrier carrier = carrierManagementService.getCarrier(carrierMes);
   ```

5. **Group Hold Management**: When retrieving carriers for group hold operations
   ```java
   List<Carrier> carriers = carrierManagementService.getGroupHoldCarriers(criteria, page, size);
   ```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Invalid Carrier Positions**: Carriers reported in incorrect positions within lanes
2. **Missing Valid Destinations**: Valid destinations not properly identified for carriers
3. **Storage State Inconsistencies**: Storage state not reflecting actual carrier positions
4. **Carrier Conversion Errors**: Errors when converting between CarrierMes and Carrier objects
5. **Connection Status Issues**: Incorrect connection status reporting
6. **Group Hold Retrieval Failures**: Failures when retrieving carriers for group hold operations
7. **Alarm Event Display Problems**: Alarm events not properly displayed to users

### Debugging Steps
1. **Invalid Carrier Positions**:
   - Check the implementation of `getPositionInLane` method
   - Verify the database state for carrier positions
   - Check for concurrent modifications to carrier positions
   - Review logs for position calculation errors
   - Test with known carrier numbers and lane IDs

2. **Missing Valid Destinations**:
   - Check the implementation of `getValidDestinationStops` method
   - Verify the ValidDestination records in the database
   - Check for configuration issues affecting destination determination
   - Review logs for destination retrieval errors
   - Test with known stop IDs

3. **Storage State Inconsistencies**:
   - Check the implementation of `reloadStorageState` method
   - Verify the database state for carriers
   - Check for concurrent modifications to the storage state
   - Review logs for storage state reload errors
   - Test with a controlled storage state reload

4. **Carrier Conversion Errors**:
   - Check the implementation of `getCarrier` method
   - Verify the CarrierMes and Carrier object structures
   - Check for null values or missing fields during conversion
   - Review logs for conversion errors
   - Test with known CarrierMes objects

5. **Connection Status Issues**:
   - Check the implementation of `isDisconnected` and `isConnected` methods
   - Verify the connection state management
   - Check for event handling issues affecting connection state
   - Review logs for connection state changes
   - Test connection state reporting with known connection states
