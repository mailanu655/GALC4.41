# StoreOutRuleBase Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `StoreOutRuleBase` abstract class provides a base implementation of the `StoreOutRule` interface and serves as a foundation for concrete store-out rules in the stamp storage system. It implements the Chain of Responsibility design pattern, allowing rules to be chained together and evaluated in sequence to determine the appropriate storage row from which to retrieve a carrier.

## Logic/Functionality
- Implements the `StoreOutRule` interface
- Provides a template method pattern for rule processing
- Manages the next rule in the chain
- Handles common functionality such as logging, error handling, and rule chaining
- Provides access to the storage state and storage state wrapper
- Supports rule identification based on lane condition and priority

## Flow
1. The `processRule()` method is called with a die for which a carrier needs to be retrieved
2. It calls the abstract `computeLane()` method, which concrete subclasses must implement
3. If a suitable lane is found, it logs the rule application and returns the lane
4. If no suitable lane is found or the lane is unavailable, it passes control to the next rule in the chain
5. If there is no next rule, it logs an error and throws a `NoApplicableRuleFoundException`

## Key Elements
- **nextRule**: Reference to the next rule in the chain
- **storageStateContext**: Provides access to the storage state
- **storageStateStoreOutWrapper**: Wrapper for storage state operations specific to store-out
- **laneCondition**: Optional lane condition for rule identification
- **priority**: Optional priority for rule identification
- **processRule()**: Template method that orchestrates the rule evaluation process
- **computeLane()**: Abstract method that concrete subclasses must implement
- **processNextRule()**: Handles passing control to the next rule in the chain

## Usage
This class is extended by concrete store-out rules that provide specific storage row selection logic:

```java
// Example of how this class would be extended
public class ConcreteStoreOutRule extends StoreOutRuleBase {
    
    public ConcreteStoreOutRule(StorageStateContext storageStateContext, StoreOutRule nextRule, 
                               LaneCondition laneCondition, StoragePriority.Priority priority) {
        super(storageStateContext, nextRule, laneCondition, priority);
    }
    
    @Override
    public StorageRow computeLane(Die die) {
        // Implement rule-specific logic to find an appropriate lane
        StorageRow selectedRow = null;
        
        // Try to find an appropriate row based on rule criteria
        // ...
        
        // Return the selected row or null if no suitable row is found
        return selectedRow;
    }
}
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Rule implementation errors**: Concrete subclasses may not correctly implement the `computeLane()` method
2. **Null reference exceptions**: References to storage state, context, or wrapper may be null
3. **Incorrect rule chaining**: Rules may not be properly connected in the chain
4. **Performance issues**: Complex rule logic or inefficient storage state access may impact performance
5. **Logging overhead**: Excessive logging in high-volume scenarios may impact performance

### Debugging Steps
1. **For rule implementation errors**:
   - Check if concrete subclasses correctly implement the `computeLane()` method
   - Verify that the implementation returns appropriate results
   - Examine the rule logic to ensure it correctly evaluates dies
   - Check for any exceptions during rule processing

2. **For null reference exceptions**:
   - Verify that the storage state context is properly initialized
   - Check if the storage state wrapper is created correctly
   - Ensure that all required dependencies are provided to the constructor

3. **For incorrect rule chaining**:
   - Review the rule chain setup to ensure rules are correctly connected
   - Verify that the next rule is properly passed to the constructor
   - Check if rules are being skipped or evaluated out of order

4. **For performance issues**:
   - Analyze the performance of storage state access operations
   - Look for inefficient algorithms or repeated operations
   - Consider caching frequently accessed data

### Resolution
1. **For rule implementation errors**:
   - Provide clear documentation for the `computeLane()` method
   - Implement validation to ensure correct rule implementation
   - Add unit tests for concrete rule implementations

2. **For null reference exceptions**:
   - Add null checks for critical references
   - Implement defensive programming techniques
   - Enhance error handling for null references

3. **For incorrect rule chaining**:
   - Implement a rule chain builder to ensure correct chaining
   - Add validation to verify rule chain integrity
   - Enhance logging to track rule chain execution

4. **For performance issues**:
   - Optimize storage state access operations
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider batch processing for high-volume scenarios

### Monitoring
1. **Track rule processing**: Monitor which rules are being applied and how often
2. **Alert on chain termination**: Set up alerts for when the rule chain terminates without finding a location
3. **Monitor rule performance**: Track the performance of individual rules and the overall chain
4. **Log rule decisions**: Maintain detailed logs of rule decisions for troubleshooting
5. **Monitor exception rates**: Track exceptions thrown during rule processing
