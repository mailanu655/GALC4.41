# StoreOutRule Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `StoreOutRule` interface defines the contract for rules that determine from which storage row carriers should be retrieved in the stamp storage system. It serves as the foundation for the rule chain pattern used to find appropriate storage rows for carrier retrieval based on various criteria.

## Logic/Functionality
- Defines a single method `processRule()` that evaluates a die and returns an appropriate storage row
- Serves as the base interface for all store-out rules in the system
- Enables the implementation of the Chain of Responsibility design pattern for rule processing
- Allows for flexible and extensible rule-based decision making for carrier retrieval

## Flow
1. A component that needs to retrieve a carrier calls the `processRule()` method on the first rule in the chain
2. Each rule evaluates whether it can determine an appropriate storage row for retrieving a carrier with the specified die
3. If a rule can determine a location, it returns the selected storage row
4. If a rule cannot determine a location, it passes the die to the next rule in the chain
5. This continues until either a suitable location is found or all rules have been evaluated

## Key Elements
- **processRule()**: The core method that evaluates a die and returns an appropriate storage row
  - Takes a `Die` parameter representing the die for which a carrier should be retrieved
  - Returns a `StorageRow` representing the selected storage location, or null if no suitable location is found

## Usage
This interface is implemented by classes that provide specific storage row selection logic for carrier retrieval:

```java
// Example of how this interface would be used
public class ConcreteStoreOutRule implements StoreOutRule {
    private StoreOutRule nextRule;
    
    public ConcreteStoreOutRule(StoreOutRule nextRule) {
        this.nextRule = nextRule;
    }
    
    @Override
    public StorageRow processRule(Die die) {
        // Implement rule-specific logic
        StorageRow selectedRow = null;
        
        // Try to find an appropriate row based on rule criteria
        // ...
        
        // If a row is found, return it
        if (selectedRow != null) {
            return selectedRow;
        }
        
        // Otherwise, pass to the next rule if available
        if (nextRule != null) {
            return nextRule.processRule(die);
        }
        
        // No suitable row found and no next rule
        return null;
    }
}
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Rule chain termination**: The rule chain may terminate without finding a suitable retrieval location
2. **Incorrect rule ordering**: Rules may be ordered incorrectly, leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions
3. **Missing rule implementations**: Required rules may be missing from the chain
4. **Infinite loops**: Poorly implemented rules may cause infinite loops in the chain
5. **Performance issues**: Complex rule logic or long chains may impact performance

### Debugging Steps
1. **For rule chain termination**:
   - Check if all possible retrieval scenarios are covered by the rule chain
   - Verify that rules are correctly implemented and connected
   - Examine the die properties to ensure they are correctly set
   - Check for any exceptions during rule processing

2. **For incorrect rule ordering**:
   - Review the rule chain setup to ensure rules are in the correct order
   - Verify that more specific rules come before more general rules
   - Check if rule priorities are correctly assigned

3. **For missing rule implementations**:
   - Review the rule chain to ensure all required rules are included
   - Verify that rules cover all possible retrieval scenarios
   - Check if new retrieval requirements have been added without corresponding rules

4. **For infinite loops**:
   - Ensure that rules properly pass control to the next rule
   - Check for circular references in the rule chain
   - Verify that rules make progress toward a decision

### Resolution
1. **For rule chain termination**:
   - Add a fallback rule at the end of the chain
   - Implement more comprehensive rule coverage
   - Enhance error handling to provide better feedback

2. **For incorrect rule ordering**:
   - Review and update the rule chain setup
   - Implement rule priority mechanisms
   - Add validation to ensure correct rule ordering

3. **For missing rule implementations**:
   - Identify and implement missing rules
   - Add validation to ensure complete rule coverage
   - Implement a rule registry to track available rules

4. **For infinite loops**:
   - Add loop detection mechanisms
   - Implement maximum iteration limits
   - Enhance logging to track rule chain execution

### Monitoring
1. **Track rule processing**: Monitor which rules are being applied and how often
2. **Alert on chain termination**: Set up alerts for when the rule chain terminates without finding a location
3. **Monitor rule performance**: Track the performance of individual rules and the overall chain
4. **Log rule decisions**: Maintain detailed logs of rule decisions for troubleshooting
5. **Monitor rule coverage**: Periodically validate that rules cover all possible retrieval scenarios
