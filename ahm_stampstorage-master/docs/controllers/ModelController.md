# ModelController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `ModelController` class manages the Model entities in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Model records, which represent vehicle models and their associated dies. Models are a fundamental component of the system, as they define the relationship between vehicle models and the dies used to produce parts for those models. This controller enables administrators to maintain the model catalog, ensuring that the system has accurate information about which dies are used for which vehicle models.

## Logic/Functionality
The class implements the following key functionality:

1. **Model Creation**: Allows administrators to create new Model records with associated dies.
2. **Model Retrieval**: Provides methods to retrieve individual Model records or lists of Models.
3. **Model Update**: Enables administrators to update existing Model records.
4. **Model Deletion**: Allows administrators to delete Model records that are no longer needed.
5. **Die Association**: Manages the association between Models and Dies, ensuring that each Model has the correct dies associated with it.

## Flow
The `ModelController` class interacts with the system in the following way:

1. **Model Creation**:
   - User accesses the model creation form via the `/models?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves all Dies from the database to populate the die selection dropdown
   - Controller displays the model creation form
   - User submits the form with model information via the `/models` endpoint (POST)
   - Controller validates the model information
   - Controller logs the user who created the model
   - Controller persists the Model record to the database
   - Controller redirects to the model detail view

2. **Model Retrieval**:
   - User accesses the model list via the `/models` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves all Models from the database, with pagination if requested
   - Controller displays the model list
   - User accesses a specific model via the `/models/{id}` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the specified Model from the database
   - Controller displays the model detail view

3. **Model Update**:
   - User accesses the model update form via the `/models/{id}?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the specified Model from the database
   - Controller retrieves all Dies from the database to populate the die selection dropdown
   - Controller displays the model update form with the current model information
   - User submits the form with updated model information via the `/models` endpoint (PUT)
   - Controller validates the updated model information
   - Controller logs the user who updated the model
   - Controller updates the Model record in the database
   - Controller redirects to the model detail view

4. **Model Deletion**:
   - User submits a model deletion request via the `/models/{id}` endpoint (DELETE)
   - Controller logs the user who deleted the model
   - Controller deletes the Model record from the database
   - Controller redirects to the model list

## Key Elements
- **Model**: A domain class that represents a vehicle model, containing properties such as name, description, active status, and associated dies.
- **Die**: A domain class that represents a die used to produce parts, referenced by the Model class.
- **Logging**: The controller logs user actions for auditing purposes, capturing who created, updated, or deleted models.
- **Validation**: The controller validates model information to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
- **Security Context**: The controller uses the Spring Security context to retrieve the current user for logging purposes.

## Usage
The `ModelController` class is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Model Catalog Management**: Administrators can create, update, and delete models to maintain an accurate catalog of vehicle models and their associated dies.
2. **Die Association**: Administrators can associate dies with models to define which dies are used to produce parts for which vehicle models.
3. **Model Information Retrieval**: Users can view the list of models and detailed information about specific models.

Example URL patterns:
- `/models?form` (GET) - Display the model creation form
- `/models` (POST) - Create a new model
- `/models` (GET) - Display the list of models
- `/models/{id}` (GET) - Display detailed information about a specific model
- `/models/{id}?form` (GET) - Display the model update form
- `/models` (PUT) - Update an existing model
- `/models/{id}` (DELETE) - Delete a model

## Database Tables
The `ModelController` interacts with the following database tables:

1. **MODEL**: Stores model information with the following columns:
   - **ID**: The unique identifier for the model (primary key)
   - **VERSION**: Version number for optimistic locking
   - **NAME**: The name of the model
   - **DESCRIPTION**: The description of the model
   - **ACTIVE**: Whether the model is active
   - **LEFT_DIE**: The ID of the left die for the model (foreign key to DIE)
   - **RIGHT_DIE**: The ID of the right die for the model (foreign key to DIE)

2. **DIE**: Referenced by the MODEL table, stores die information with the following columns:
   - **ID**: The unique identifier for the die (primary key)
   - **VERSION**: Version number for optimistic locking
   - **DESCRIPTION**: The description of the die
   - **PART_PRODUCTION_VOLUME**: The production volume of the die (enumeration value)
   - **ACTIVE**: Whether the die is active
   - **BACKGROUND_COLOR**: The background color for the die in the UI
   - **TEXT_COLOR**: The text color for the die in the UI
   - **IMAGE_FILE_NAME**: The name of the image file for the die

The controller primarily reads from and writes to the MODEL table, and reads from the DIE table to populate die selection dropdowns.

## Implementation Details

The `ModelController` is a Spring MVC controller annotated with `@Controller` and mapped to the `/models` URL path. It provides a RESTful interface for managing Model entities, with methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting models.

The controller uses the `@ModelAttribute` annotation to populate model attributes that are used across multiple handler methods, such as the list of all models and the list of all dies. This reduces code duplication and ensures consistent data access.

The controller implements standard CRUD operations for Model entities:
- `create`: Creates a new Model entity based on form submission data.
- `createForm`: Displays the model creation form.
- `show`: Displays detailed information about a specific Model.
- `list`: Displays a paginated list of all Models.
- `update`: Updates an existing Model entity based on form submission data.
- `updateForm`: Displays the model update form for a specific Model.
- `delete`: Deletes a specific Model entity.

The controller also provides helper methods:
- `populateModels`: Populates the list of all models for use in views.
- `populateDies`: Populates the list of all dies for use in die selection dropdowns.
- `encodeUrlPathSegment`: Encodes URL path segments for use in redirects.

The controller uses Spring's validation framework to validate model information before persisting it to the database. If validation fails, the controller returns to the form view with error messages.

The controller logs user actions for auditing purposes, capturing who created, updated, or deleted models. It uses the Spring Security context to retrieve the current user for logging.

The controller handles exceptions that may occur during model operations, providing informative error messages to help administrators identify and resolve issues.
