# OrderFulfillmentController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `OrderFulfillmentController` class manages the OrderFulfillment entities in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting OrderFulfillment records, which represent the fulfillment of weld orders with specific carriers. This controller is essential for weld order management, enabling administrators to track which carriers are assigned to fulfill specific weld orders.

## Logic/Functionality
The class implements the following key functionality:

1. **OrderFulfillment Creation**: Allows administrators to create new OrderFulfillment records with details such as weld order, carrier number, and quantity.
2. **OrderFulfillment Retrieval**: Provides methods to retrieve individual OrderFulfillment records or lists of OrderFulfillments.
3. **OrderFulfillment Update**: Enables administrators to update existing OrderFulfillment records.
4. **OrderFulfillment Deletion**: Allows administrators to delete OrderFulfillment records.
5. **OrderFulfillment Population**: Provides methods to populate OrderFulfillment data for use in forms and views.
6. **Composite Key Handling**: Manages the composite primary key (OrderFulfillmentPk) for OrderFulfillment records, including conversion between the key and its string representation.

## Flow
The `OrderFulfillmentController` class interacts with the system in the following way:

1. **OrderFulfillment Creation**:
   - User accesses the OrderFulfillment creation form via the `/orderfulfillments?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller displays the form for entering OrderFulfillment data
   - User submits the form with OrderFulfillment data via the `/orderfulfillments` endpoint (POST)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller creates a new OrderFulfillment record
   - Controller redirects the user to the newly created OrderFulfillment's detail page

2. **OrderFulfillment Retrieval**:
   - User accesses a specific OrderFulfillment via the `/orderfulfillments/{id}` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller converts the string ID to an OrderFulfillmentPk using the conversion service
   - Controller retrieves the OrderFulfillment from the database
   - Controller displays the OrderFulfillment details to the user

   - User accesses the list of OrderFulfillments via the `/orderfulfillments` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves OrderFulfillments from the database, with pagination if specified
   - Controller displays the list of OrderFulfillments to the user

3. **OrderFulfillment Update**:
   - User accesses the OrderFulfillment update form via the `/orderfulfillments/{id}?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller converts the string ID to an OrderFulfillmentPk using the conversion service
   - Controller retrieves the OrderFulfillment from the database
   - Controller displays the form with the OrderFulfillment data
   - User submits the form with updated OrderFulfillment data via the `/orderfulfillments` endpoint (PUT)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller updates the OrderFulfillment record
   - Controller redirects the user to the updated OrderFulfillment's detail page

4. **OrderFulfillment Deletion**:
   - User submits a delete request via the `/orderfulfillments/{id}` endpoint (DELETE)
   - Controller converts the string ID to an OrderFulfillmentPk using the conversion service
   - Controller deletes the OrderFulfillment from the database
   - Controller redirects the user to the OrderFulfillment list page

## Key Elements
- **OrderFulfillment**: A domain class that represents the fulfillment of a weld order with a specific carrier, containing properties such as weld order, carrier number, and quantity.
- **OrderFulfillmentPk**: A composite primary key class for OrderFulfillment, containing the weld order, carrier number, and release cycle.
- **ConversionService**: An autowired service that provides methods for converting between OrderFulfillmentPk and its string representation.
- **Validation**: The controller validates OrderFulfillment data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
- **Pagination**: The controller supports pagination for the OrderFulfillment list to handle large numbers of OrderFulfillments efficiently.
- **URL Encoding**: The controller encodes URL path segments to ensure proper handling of special characters.

## Usage
The `OrderFulfillmentController` class is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Weld Order Fulfillment**: Administrators can create, view, update, and delete OrderFulfillments to track which carriers are assigned to fulfill specific weld orders.
2. **Carrier Assignment**: Administrators can assign carriers to weld orders to fulfill production requirements.
3. **Fulfillment Tracking**: Administrators can track the status of weld order fulfillment to monitor production progress.

Example URL patterns:
- `/orderfulfillments?form` (GET) - Display the OrderFulfillment creation form
- `/orderfulfillments` (POST) - Create a new OrderFulfillment
- `/orderfulfillments/{id}` (GET) - Display a specific OrderFulfillment
- `/orderfulfillments` (GET) - Display the list of OrderFulfillments
- `/orderfulfillments/{id}?form` (GET) - Display the OrderFulfillment update form
- `/orderfulfillments` (PUT) - Update an existing OrderFulfillment
- `/orderfulfillments/{id}` (DELETE) - Delete an OrderFulfillment
