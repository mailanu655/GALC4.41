# OrderMgrController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `OrderMgrController` class manages the OrderMgr entities in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting OrderMgr records, which represent weld line order managers. This controller is essential for weld line order management, enabling administrators to define and manage order managers that control the flow of carriers to weld lines.

## Logic/Functionality
The class implements the following key functionality:

1. **OrderMgr Creation**: Allows administrators to create new OrderMgr records with details such as line name and associated stops.
2. **OrderMgr Retrieval**: Provides methods to retrieve individual OrderMgr records or lists of OrderMgrs.
3. **OrderMgr Update**: Enables administrators to update existing OrderMgr records.
4. **OrderMgr Deletion**: Allows administrators to delete OrderMgr records.
5. **OrderMgr Population**: Provides methods to populate OrderMgr data for use in forms and views.
6. **User Tracking**: Logs the user who performs create, update, and delete operations for auditing purposes.

## Flow
The `OrderMgrController` class interacts with the system in the following way:

1. **OrderMgr Creation**:
   - User accesses the OrderMgr creation form via the `/ordermgrs?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller displays the form for entering OrderMgr data
   - User submits the form with OrderMgr data via the `/ordermgrs` endpoint (POST)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller logs the user who created the OrderMgr
   - Controller creates a new OrderMgr record
   - Controller redirects the user to the newly created OrderMgr's detail page

2. **OrderMgr Retrieval**:
   - User accesses a specific OrderMgr via the `/ordermgrs/{id}` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the OrderMgr from the database
   - Controller displays the OrderMgr details to the user

   - User accesses the list of OrderMgrs via the `/ordermgrs` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves OrderMgrs from the database, with pagination if specified
   - Controller displays the list of OrderMgrs to the user

3. **OrderMgr Update**:
   - User accesses the OrderMgr update form via the `/ordermgrs/{id}?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the OrderMgr from the database
   - Controller displays the form with the OrderMgr data
   - User submits the form with updated OrderMgr data via the `/ordermgrs` endpoint (PUT)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller logs the user who updated the OrderMgr
   - Controller updates the OrderMgr record
   - Controller redirects the user to the updated OrderMgr's detail page

4. **OrderMgr Deletion**:
   - User submits a delete request via the `/ordermgrs/{id}` endpoint (DELETE)
   - Controller logs the user who deleted the OrderMgr
   - Controller deletes the OrderMgr from the database
   - Controller redirects the user to the OrderMgr list page

## Key Elements
- **OrderMgr**: A domain class that represents a weld line order manager, containing properties such as line name and associated stops.
- **Stop**: A domain class that represents a physical location in the conveyor system, referenced by the OrderMgr class.
- **WeldOrder**: A domain class that represents a weld order, associated with an OrderMgr.
- **Validation**: The controller validates OrderMgr data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
- **Pagination**: The controller supports pagination for the OrderMgr list to handle large numbers of OrderMgrs efficiently.
- **Logging**: The controller logs user actions for auditing purposes.
- **URL Encoding**: The controller encodes URL path segments to ensure proper handling of special characters.

## Usage
The `OrderMgrController` class is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Weld Line Configuration**: Administrators can create, view, update, and delete OrderMgrs to configure weld lines.
2. **Order Management**: Administrators can define order managers to control the flow of carriers to weld lines.
3. **System Configuration**: Administrators can configure the system to handle different weld line configurations.

Example URL patterns:
- `/ordermgrs?form` (GET) - Display the OrderMgr creation form
- `/ordermgrs` (POST) - Create a new OrderMgr
- `/ordermgrs/{id}` (GET) - Display a specific OrderMgr
- `/ordermgrs` (GET) - Display the list of OrderMgrs
- `/ordermgrs/{id}?form` (GET) - Display the OrderMgr update form
- `/ordermgrs` (PUT) - Update an existing OrderMgr
- `/ordermgrs/{id}` (DELETE) - Delete an OrderMgr

   - **DELIVERY_STATUS**: The status of the delivery (enumeration value)
   - **CREATED_BY**: The user who created the order
   - **CREATED_DATE**: The date the order was created
   - **COMMENTS**: Comments about the order
   - **LEFT_DELIVERY_COMMENTS**: Comments about left-hand part delivery
   - **RIGHT_DELIVERY_COMMENTS**: Comments about right-hand part delivery
   - **LEFT_FULFILLMENT_COMMENTS**: Comments about left-hand part fulfillment
