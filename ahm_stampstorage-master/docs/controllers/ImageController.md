# ImageController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `ImageController` class manages image resources in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality for serving images stored in the database, uploading new images, and managing image metadata. This controller is essential for the visual representation of dies and other components in the system, enabling administrators to view and manage images associated with these components.

## Logic/Functionality
The class implements the following key functionality:

1. **Image Serving**: Retrieves images from the database and serves them to clients based on the image name and extension.
2. **Test Image Insertion**: Provides a method for inserting a test image into the database for testing purposes.
3. **Image Upload**: Allows administrators to upload new images to the database, with validation for file type and content.
4. **Image Listing**: Retrieves and displays a list of available images in the system.

## Flow
The `ImageController` class interacts with the system in the following way:

1. **Image Serving**:
   - Client requests an image via the `/resources/images/{imageName}.{ext}` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the image from the database based on the image name and extension
   - If the image exists, the controller sets the appropriate content type and serves the image bytes
   - If the image does not exist, the controller returns a 404 Not Found response

2. **Test Image Insertion**:
   - Administrator accesses the test image insertion endpoint via the `/resources/images/putTestImage` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller logs the user who initiated the insertion
   - Controller retrieves the test image bytes from the classpath
   - Controller creates a new StampingImage record with the test image bytes and name
   - Controller persists the StampingImage record to the database
   - Controller returns a success message

3. **Image Upload**:
   - Administrator accesses the image upload form via the `/uploadImage` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves a list of available images from the database
   - Controller displays the upload form with the list of available images
   - Administrator submits the form with an image file via the `/uploadImage` endpoint (POST)
   - Controller validates the file type and content
   - Controller logs the user who uploaded the image
   - Controller creates a new StampingImage record with the uploaded image bytes and name
   - Controller persists the StampingImage record to the database
   - Controller displays a success message with the updated list of available images

## Key Elements
- **StampingImage**: A domain class that represents an image stored in the database, containing properties such as image name and image bytes.
- **MultipartFile**: A Spring class that represents an uploaded file, used for handling image uploads.
- **ByteArrayOutputStream**: A Java class used for reading image bytes from the classpath.
- **Validation**: The controller validates uploaded files to ensure they are valid image files.
- **Logging**: The controller logs user actions for auditing purposes.
- **Content Type Handling**: The controller sets the appropriate content type for served images based on the file extension.

## Usage
The `ImageController` class is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Die Visualization**: The system uses images to visually represent dies in the user interface, helping administrators identify and manage dies.
2. **Image Management**: Administrators can upload and manage images associated with system components.
3. **System Testing**: Developers can insert test images for testing the image serving functionality.

Example URL patterns:
- `/resources/images/{imageName}.{ext}` (GET) - Serve an image from the database
- `/resources/images/putTestImage` (GET) - Insert a test image into the database
- `/uploadImage` (GET) - Display the image upload form
- `/uploadImage` (POST) - Upload an image to the database

## Database Tables
The `ImageController` interacts with the following database tables:

1. **STAMPING_IMAGE**: Stores image information with the following columns:
   - **ID**: The unique identifier for the image (primary key)
   - **VERSION**: Version number for optimistic locking
   - **IMAGE_NAME**: The name of the image
   - **IMAGE_BYTES**: The binary content of the image

The controller primarily reads from and writes to the STAMPING_IMAGE table.

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues

1. **Image Not Found Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Images are not displayed in the user interface, or a 404 Not Found response is returned when requesting an image.
   - **Cause**: The requested image does not exist in the database, or the image name or extension is incorrect.
   - **Impact**: Administrators cannot see visual representations of dies or other components, potentially affecting system usability.

2. **Image Upload Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Image upload fails or produces unexpected results.
   - **Cause**: Issues with file validation, file size, file type, or database persistence.

## Implementation Details

The `ImageController` is a Spring MVC controller that handles image-related operations in the StampStorage system. It is not annotated with `@RequestMapping` at the class level, allowing individual methods to define their own request mappings.

### Image Serving
The `getImage` method is mapped to `/resources/images/{imageName}.{ext}` and handles GET requests for images. It retrieves the image from the database using the `StampingImage.findStampingImage` method, which returns a `StampingImage` object containing the image bytes and metadata. If the image exists, the method sets the appropriate content type based on the file extension and writes the image bytes to the response output stream. If the image does not exist, it returns a 404 Not Found response.

### Test Image Insertion
The `putTestImage` method is mapped to `/resources/images/putTestImage` and handles GET requests for inserting a test image. It logs the user who initiated the insertion, retrieves the test image bytes from the classpath using the `getFileBytes` method, creates a new `StampingImage` object with the test image bytes and name, and persists it to the database using the `merge` method. It returns a success message as a response body.

### Image Upload
The `handleFileUpload` method is mapped to `/uploadImage` and handles POST requests for uploading images. It validates the uploaded file to ensure it is not empty, has a valid file name, and is a supported image type (BMP, PNG, GIF, JPG, or TIFF). If the validation passes, it logs the user who uploaded the image, creates a new `StampingImage` object with the uploaded image bytes and name, and persists it to the database using the `merge` method. It then retrieves a sorted list of available images and displays the upload form with a success message and the updated list.

The `openUploadPage` method is mapped to `/uploadImage` and handles GET requests for displaying the image upload form. It retrieves a sorted list of available images from the database and displays the upload form with the list.

### Helper Methods
The `getFileBytes` method is a private helper method that reads a file from the classpath and returns its bytes. It uses a `ByteArrayOutputStream` to read the file bytes from an `InputStream` obtained from the thread's context class loader.

The controller also includes a comparator for sorting image names in a case-insensitive manner, used when retrieving the list of available images for display in the upload form.
