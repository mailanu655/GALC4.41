# CarrierReleaseController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `CarrierReleaseController` manages web requests related to carrier release operations in the StampStorage system. It handles CRUD operations for CarrierRelease records, which represent carriers scheduled for release from storage to specific destinations. This controller is essential for managing the flow of carriers out of storage areas and into production lines or other destinations within the manufacturing facility.

## Logic/Functionality
The controller implements several key functionalities:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete operations for CarrierRelease records
2. **Pagination Support**: Handles pagination for carrier release lists
3. **Form Handling**: Processes form submissions for carrier release operations
4. **Dependency Management**: Manages dependencies between CarrierRelease and other entities
5. **Row Reordering**: Triggers reordering of carriers in storage rows after release operations

## Flow
The controller operates in the following workflow:

1. User accesses carrier release pages through the web interface
2. Controller handles the request and retrieves appropriate carrier release data
3. Controller prepares the model with carrier release information
4. View renders the carrier release information to the user
5. User may perform CRUD operations on carrier release records
6. Controller processes these operations and updates the database accordingly
7. For delete operations, the controller may trigger reordering of carriers in affected storage rows

## Key Elements
- **create/createForm**: Creates a new carrier release record
- **show**: Displays details of a specific carrier release record
- **list**: Displays a list of carrier release records with pagination support
- **update/updateForm**: Updates an existing carrier release record
- **delete**: Deletes a carrier release record and triggers row reordering if necessary
- **populateCarrierReleases**: Populates the model with carrier release data
- **populateStops**: Populates the model with stop data for destination selection

## Usage
The `CarrierReleaseController` is accessed through the following URL patterns:

1. **List Carrier Releases**: `/carrierreleases` (GET)
   - Displays a list of carrier release records
   - Supports pagination with `page` and `size` parameters

2. **Show Carrier Release**: `/carrierreleases/{id}` (GET)
   - Displays details of a specific carrier release record
   - Requires carrier release ID as a path variable

3. **Create Carrier Release**: `/carrierreleases?form` (GET), `/carrierreleases` (POST)
   - GET request displays the creation form
   - POST request processes the form submission and creates the record

4. **Update Carrier Release**: `/carrierreleases/{id}?form` (GET), `/carrierreleases` (PUT)
   - GET request displays the update form for a specific record
   - PUT request processes the form submission and updates the record

5. **Delete Carrier Release**: `/carrierreleases/{id}` (DELETE)
   - Deletes a specific carrier release record
   - Requires carrier release ID as a path variable
   - May trigger reordering of carriers in affected storage rows

## Database Tables
The `CarrierReleaseController` interacts with the following database tables:

1. **CARRIER_RELEASE**: Stores carrier release records including:
   - ID: Primary key (same as carrier number)
   - SOURCE: Source of the release operation
   - DESTINATION: Reference to the destination stop
   - TIMESTAMP: Timestamp of the release operation

2. **CARRIER_MES**: Referenced to find carrier information by carrier number
   - CARRIER_NUMBER: The carrier number (used to link with CARRIER_RELEASE.ID)
   - CURRENT_LOCATION: The current location of the carrier

3. **STOP**: Referenced for destination information
   - ID: Primary key (referenced by CARRIER_RELEASE.DESTINATION)
   - NAME: Name of the stop
   - STOP_TYPE: Type of the stop

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Row Reordering Failures**: Problems with reordering carriers in storage rows after release
2. **Dependency Resolution Failures**: Issues with resolving dependencies between entities
3. **Form Validation Errors**: Problems with form validation for carrier release operations
4. **Pagination Problems**: Issues with pagination of carrier release lists
5. **Concurrent Modification Issues**: Problems with concurrent modifications to carrier release records
6. **Missing Destination Stops**: Issues with missing or invalid destination stops
7. **Carrier Not Found**: Problems with finding carriers by carrier number

### Debugging Steps

4. **Pagination Problems**:
   - Check the pagination parameters in the `list` method
   - Verify the calculation of page numbers and sizes
   - Check for off-by-one errors in pagination
