# WeldScheduleController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `WeldScheduleController` class manages the WeldSchedule entities in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting WeldSchedule records, which represent the production schedules for weld lines. This controller is essential for tracking and managing the production plans and progress for weld lines, enabling administrators to define and monitor production schedules.

## Logic/Functionality
The class implements the following key functionality:

1. **WeldSchedule Creation**: Allows administrators to create new WeldSchedule records with details such as weld line, production plans, and remaining production.
2. **WeldSchedule Retrieval**: Provides methods to retrieve individual WeldSchedule records or lists of WeldSchedules.
3. **WeldSchedule Update**: Enables administrators to update existing WeldSchedule records.
4. **WeldSchedule Deletion**: Allows administrators to delete WeldSchedule records.
5. **WeldSchedule Population**: Provides methods to populate WeldSchedule data for use in forms and views.

## Flow
The `WeldScheduleController` class interacts with the system in the following way:

1. **WeldSchedule Creation**:
   - User accesses the WeldSchedule creation form via the `/weldschedules?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller displays the form for entering WeldSchedule data
   - User submits the form with WeldSchedule data via the `/weldschedules` endpoint (POST)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller creates a new WeldSchedule record
   - Controller redirects the user to the newly created WeldSchedule's detail page

2. **WeldSchedule Retrieval**:
   - User accesses a specific WeldSchedule via the `/weldschedules/{id}` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the WeldSchedule from the database
   - Controller displays the WeldSchedule details to the user

   - User accesses the list of WeldSchedules via the `/weldschedules` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves WeldSchedules from the database, with pagination if specified
   - Controller displays the list of WeldSchedules to the user

3. **WeldSchedule Update**:
   - User accesses the WeldSchedule update form via the `/weldschedules/{id}?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the WeldSchedule from the database
   - Controller displays the form with the WeldSchedule data
   - User submits the form with updated WeldSchedule data via the `/weldschedules` endpoint (PUT)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller updates the WeldSchedule record
   - Controller redirects the user to the updated WeldSchedule's detail page

4. **WeldSchedule Deletion**:
   - User submits a delete request via the `/weldschedules/{id}` endpoint (DELETE)
   - Controller deletes the WeldSchedule from the database
   - Controller redirects the user to the WeldSchedule list page

## Key Elements
- **WeldSchedule**: A domain class that represents a production schedule for a weld line, containing properties such as weld line, production plans, and remaining production.
- **Validation**: The controller validates WeldSchedule data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
- **Pagination**: The controller supports pagination for the WeldSchedule list to handle large numbers of WeldSchedules efficiently.
- **URL Encoding**: The controller encodes URL path segments to ensure proper handling of special characters.

## Usage
The `WeldScheduleController` class is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Production Planning**: Administrators can create and update WeldSchedules to define production plans for weld lines.
2. **Production Monitoring**: Administrators can view WeldSchedules to monitor production progress and remaining work.
3. **Production History**: Administrators can view historical WeldSchedules to analyze past production performance.

Example URL patterns:
- `/weldschedules?form` (GET) - Display the WeldSchedule creation form
- `/weldschedules` (POST) - Create a new WeldSchedule
- `/weldschedules/{id}` (GET) - Display a specific WeldSchedule
- `/weldschedules` (GET) - Display the list of WeldSchedules
- `/weldschedules/{id}?form` (GET) - Display the WeldSchedule update form
- `/weldschedules` (PUT) - Update an existing WeldSchedule
- `/weldschedules/{id}` (DELETE) - Delete a WeldSchedule

## Database Tables
The `WeldScheduleController` interacts with the following database table:

1. **WELD_SCHEDULE**: Stores WeldSchedule information with the following columns:
   - **ID**: The unique identifier for the WeldSchedule (primary key)
   - **VERSION**: Version number for optimistic locking
   - **WELD_LINE**: The name of the weld line
   - **LEFT_HAND_PROD_PLAN**: The production plan for left-hand parts
   - **LEFT_HAND_PROD_REMAINING**: The remaining production for left-hand parts
   - **RIGHT_HAND_PROD_PLAN**: The production plan for right-hand parts
   - **RIGHT_HAND_PROD_REMAINING**: The remaining production for right-hand parts

The controller primarily reads from and writes to the WELD_SCHEDULE table.

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues

1. **Validation Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: WeldSchedule creation or update fails with validation errors.
   - **Cause**: The WeldSchedule data does not meet the required format or constraints.
   - **Impact**: Administrators cannot create or update WeldSchedules, potentially affecting production planning and monitoring.

2. **Pagination Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: The WeldSchedule list does not display correctly, or pagination does not work as expected.
   - **Cause**: Issues with pagination logic or parameters.
   - **Impact**: Administrators may not be able to view all WeldSchedules, potentially affecting production planning and monitoring.

3. **URL Encoding Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: URLs with special characters do not work correctly, or redirects fail.
   - **Cause**: Issues with URL encoding logic or character encoding.
   - **Impact**: Administrators may not be able to access certain WeldSchedules or perform certain operations, potentially affecting production planning and monitoring.

4. **Concurrency Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: WeldSchedule updates fail with optimistic locking exceptions.
   - **Cause**: Multiple users attempting to update the same WeldSchedule simultaneously.
