# ResetConnectionController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `ResetConnectionController` class provides functionality to reset and manage connections to external services in the StampStorage system. It serves as a critical administrative tool that allows operators to manually reset connections when communication issues arise with external systems, particularly the MES (Manufacturing Execution System) service. This controller helps maintain system reliability by providing a mechanism to recover from connection failures without requiring a full system restart.

## Logic/Functionality
The class implements the following key functionality:

1. **Connection Reset**: Allows administrators to reset connections to external services, particularly the MES service.
2. **Service Role Update**: Updates the service roles to ensure the system is communicating with the correct service endpoints.
3. **Connection Status Reporting**: Provides feedback on the success or failure of connection reset operations.

## Flow
The `ResetConnectionController` class interacts with the system in the following way:

1. **Connection Reset**:
   - User accesses the connection reset endpoint via the `/resetConnection` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller calls the `updateServiceRoles` method on the `ServiceConnectionManager` to reset connections
   - Controller retrieves the updated service role information
   - Controller displays the result of the reset operation to the user, including the host and port of the active service

## Key Elements
- **ServiceConnectionManager**: An autowired service that manages connections to external services, providing methods to update service roles and retrieve connection information.
- **ServiceRole**: A domain class that represents a service role, containing properties such as IP address and port.
- **Exception Handling**: The controller handles exceptions that may occur during the connection reset process, providing informative error messages.
- **Result Reporting**: The controller reports the result of the connection reset operation, including success or failure status and connection details.

## Usage
The `ResetConnectionController` class is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Connection Recovery**: When connections to external services fail, administrators can use this controller to reset connections without requiring a full system restart.
2. **Service Endpoint Changes**: When service endpoints change (e.g., due to failover or maintenance), administrators can use this controller to update the system's connection information.
3. **System Troubleshooting**: During troubleshooting, administrators can use this controller to verify connection status and ensure the system is communicating with the correct service endpoints.

Example URL patterns:
- `/resetConnection` (GET) - Reset connections to external services and display the result

## Database Tables
The `ResetConnectionController` does not directly interact with any database tables. However, the `ServiceConnectionManager` that it uses may interact with the following tables:

1. **SERVICE_ROLE**: Stores service role information with the following columns:
   - **ID**: The unique identifier for the service role (primary key)
   - **VERSION**: Version number for optimistic locking
   - **ROLE_NAME**: The name of the service role
   - **IP**: The IP address of the service
   - **PORT**: The port number of the service
   - **ACTIVE**: Whether the service role is active
   - **LAST_UPDATED**: The timestamp of the last update

The controller indirectly reads from and potentially updates the SERVICE_ROLE table through the ServiceConnectionManager.

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Reset Failures**:
   - **Symptom**: Connection reset operations fail, and the system continues to experience communication issues with external services.
   - **Cause**: Issues with the `ServiceConnectionManager`, network connectivity problems, or external service unavailability.
   - **Impact**: The system cannot communicate with external services, potentially affecting core functionality such as carrier management and order fulfillment.

2. **Service Role Update Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Service role updates fail, or the system connects to the wrong service endpoints after a reset.
   - **Cause**: Issues with the service role configuration, database connectivity problems, or concurrent updates.
   - **Impact**: The system may connect to incorrect or unavailable service endpoints, potentially affecting system functionality.

3. **Exception Handling Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Connection reset operations fail with unhelpful error messages or no error messages at all.
   - **Cause**: Issues with exception handling in the controller or the `ServiceConnectionManager`.
   - **Impact**: Administrators cannot effectively troubleshoot connection issues, potentially prolonging system downtime.

4. **Result Reporting Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Connection reset operations appear to succeed, but the reported connection details are incorrect or missing.
   - **Cause**: Issues with result reporting in the controller or the `ServiceConnectionManager`.
   - **Impact**: Administrators may be misled about the actual connection status, potentially making incorrect decisions based on inaccurate information.

5. **Concurrent Reset Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Connection reset operations interfere with each other when multiple administrators attempt to reset connections simultaneously.
   - **Cause**: Lack of synchronization or locking mechanisms in the controller or the `ServiceConnectionManager`.
   - **Impact**: Connection reset operations may produce inconsistent results, potentially leaving the system in an unstable state.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Connection Reset Failures**:

## Implementation Details

The `ResetConnectionController` is a Spring MVC controller annotated with `@Controller` and mapped to the `/resetConnection` URL path. It has a single handler method, `ResetNow`, which is mapped to handle GET requests.

The controller autowires the `ServiceConnectionManager` bean, which provides methods for managing connections to external services. The `ResetNow` method calls the `updateServiceRoles` method on the `ServiceConnectionManager` to reset connections and update service roles.

The method handles exceptions that may occur during the connection reset process, providing informative error messages. It returns a success message with the host and port of the active service if the reset operation succeeds, or an error message if it fails.

The controller uses the Spring MVC model to pass the result of the reset operation to the view, which displays the result to the user. The view, `reset/resetConnection`, is a JSP page that renders the result information.

This controller is a critical administrative tool that helps maintain system reliability by providing a mechanism to recover from connection failures without requiring a full system restart. It is particularly useful in production environments where system uptime is critical and full restarts are disruptive.
