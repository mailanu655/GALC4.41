# StopController Technical Documentation

## Purpose
The `StopController` class manages the Stop entities in the StampStorage system. It provides functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Stop records, which represent physical locations in the conveyor system. This controller is essential for configuring the physical layout of the conveyor system, enabling administrators to define and manage the stops that carriers can visit during their journey through the system.

## Logic/Functionality
The class implements the following key functionality:

1. **Stop Creation**: Allows administrators to create new Stop records with details such as name, type, area, and availability.
2. **Stop Retrieval**: Provides methods to retrieve individual Stop records or lists of Stops.
3. **Stop Update**: Enables administrators to update existing Stop records.
4. **Stop Deletion**: Allows administrators to delete Stop records.
5. **Stop Population**: Provides methods to populate Stop data for use in forms and views.
6. **Exception Handling**: Handles exceptions that may occur during Stop operations, such as duplicate Stop IDs.

## Flow
The `StopController` class interacts with the system in the following way:

1. **Stop Creation**:
   - User accesses the Stop creation form via the `/stops?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller displays the form for entering Stop data
   - User submits the form with Stop data via the `/stops` endpoint (POST)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller attempts to create a new Stop record
   - If creation is successful, controller redirects the user to the newly created Stop's detail page
   - If creation fails due to a duplicate Stop ID, controller redirects the user to an exception page

2. **Stop Retrieval**:
   - User accesses a specific Stop via the `/stops/{id}` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the Stop from the database
   - Controller displays the Stop details to the user

   - User accesses the list of Stops via the `/stops` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves Stops from the database, with pagination if specified
   - Controller displays the list of Stops to the user

3. **Stop Update**:
   - User accesses the Stop update form via the `/stops/{id}?form` endpoint (GET)
   - Controller retrieves the Stop from the database
   - Controller displays the form with the Stop data
   - User submits the form with updated Stop data via the `/stops` endpoint (PUT)
   - Controller validates the data
   - Controller updates the Stop record
   - Controller redirects the user to the updated Stop's detail page

4. **Stop Deletion**:
   - User submits a delete request via the `/stops/{id}` endpoint (DELETE)
   - Controller deletes the Stop from the database
   - Controller redirects the user to the Stop list page

## Key Elements
- **Stop**: A domain class that represents a physical location in the conveyor system, containing properties such as name, type, area, and availability.
- **StopType**: An enumeration that represents the type of a Stop, such as STORE_IN_ALL_LANES or RELEASE_CHECK.
- **StopArea**: An enumeration that represents the area of a Stop, such as ROW or WELD_LINE_1.
- **StopAvailability**: An enumeration that represents the availability of a Stop, such as AVAILABLE or UNAVAILABLE.
- **Validation**: The controller validates Stop data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
- **Pagination**: The controller supports pagination for the Stop list to handle large numbers of Stops efficiently.
- **Exception Handling**: The controller handles exceptions that may occur during Stop operations, such as duplicate Stop IDs.
- **Logging**: The controller logs important events, such as Stop updates, to facilitate debugging and auditing.
- **Security Context**: The controller accesses the security context to determine the user performing the operation for logging purposes.

## Usage
The `StopController` class is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Conveyor Configuration**: Administrators can create, view, update, and delete Stops to configure the physical layout of the conveyor system.
2. **Routing Configuration**: Administrators can define the types and areas of Stops to control how carriers are routed through the conveyor system.
3. **Availability Management**: Administrators can control the availability of Stops to enable or disable certain paths through the conveyor system.

Example URL patterns:
- `/stops?form` (GET) - Display the Stop creation form
- `/stops` (POST) - Create a new Stop
- `/stops/{id}` (GET) - Display a specific Stop
- `/stops` (GET) - Display the list of Stops
- `/stops/{id}?form` (GET) - Display the Stop update form
- `/stops` (PUT) - Update an existing Stop
- `/stops/{id}` (DELETE) - Delete a Stop

## Database Tables
The `StopController` interacts with the following database table:

1. **STOP**: Stores Stop information with the following columns:
   - **ID**: The unique identifier for the Stop (primary key)
   - **VERSION**: Version number for optimistic locking
   - **NAME**: The name of the Stop
   - **STOP_TYPE**: The type of the Stop (enumeration value)
   - **STOP_AREA**: The area of the Stop (enumeration value)
   - **STOP_AVAILABILITY**: The availability of the Stop (enumeration value)
   - **CAPACITY**: The capacity of the Stop

The controller primarily reads from and writes to the STOP table.

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues

1. **Duplicate Stop ID Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Stop creation fails with a JpaSystemException.
   - **Cause**: An attempt to create a Stop with an ID that already exists in the database.
   - **Impact**: Administrators cannot create Stops with duplicate IDs, potentially affecting conveyor configuration.

2. **Validation Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Stop creation or update fails with validation errors.
   - **Cause**: The Stop data does not meet the required format or constraints.
   - **Impact**: Administrators cannot create or update Stops, potentially affecting conveyor configuration.

3. **Pagination Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: The Stop list does not display correctly, or pagination does not work as expected.
   - **Cause**: Issues with pagination logic or parameters.
   - **Impact**: Administrators may not be able to view all Stops, potentially affecting conveyor configuration.

4. **Security Context Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Stop operations are not correctly logged with the user who performed them.
   - **Cause**: Issues with accessing the security context or retrieving the user principal.
   - **Impact**: Audit logs may not correctly reflect who performed Stop operations, potentially affecting accountability.

5. **Enumeration Issues**:
   - **Symptom**: Stop creation or update fails with enumeration-related errors.
   - **Cause**: Issues with the StopType, StopArea, or StopAvailability enumerations.
