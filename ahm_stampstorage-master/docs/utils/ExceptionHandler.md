# ExceptionHandler

## Purpose
The ExceptionHandler interface defines a contract for handling exceptions in the StampStorage system. It provides a standardized way to process and respond to exceptions that occur during system operation, enabling consistent exception handling throughout the application.

## Logic/Functionality
- Defines a single method for handling exceptions
- Allows for centralized exception handling logic
- Enables different exception handling strategies to be implemented and swapped as needed
- Promotes separation of exception handling from business logic

## Flow
1. Components that need exception handling capability accept an ExceptionHandler implementation
2. When an exception occurs, the component calls the handleException method on the handler
3. The handler processes the exception according to its implementation strategy
4. This allows for consistent exception handling across the application

## Key Elements
- **handleException Method**: The core method that takes an Exception parameter and processes it

## Usage
The interface is implemented by exception handling classes and used by components that need exception handling:

```java
// Example of a class implementing the interface
public class LoggingExceptionHandler implements ExceptionHandler {
    public void handleException(Exception exception) {
        // Log the exception
        Logger.error("Exception occurred: " + exception.getMessage(), exception);
    }
}
```

Components use the interface to handle exceptions without depending on specific implementations:

```java
// Example of using the interface
public class SomeComponent {
    private ExceptionHandler exceptionHandler;
    
    public void setExceptionHandler(ExceptionHandler handler) {
        this.exceptionHandler = handler;
    }
    
    public void doSomething() {
        try {
            // Some operation that might throw an exception
        } catch (Exception e) {
            if (exceptionHandler != null) {
                exceptionHandler.handleException(e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Null Handler**: NullPointerExceptions if the handler is not set before use
2. **Unhandled Exceptions**: Exceptions that are not properly passed to the handler
3. **Handler Implementation Issues**: Problems with specific handler implementations
4. **Exception Swallowing**: Handlers that suppress exceptions without proper logging or notification

### Debugging Steps
1. **Check Handler Assignment**: Verify that an exception handler is properly assigned to components that need it
2. **Review Try-Catch Blocks**: Ensure that exceptions are properly caught and passed to the handler
3. **Examine Handler Implementations**: Review handler implementations to ensure they process exceptions correctly
4. **Test Exception Paths**: Deliberately trigger exceptions to test the handling logic

### Resolution
1. **Null Checks**: Add null checks before using the exception handler
2. **Default Handlers**: Provide default handlers to ensure exceptions are always processed
3. **Improved Implementations**: Enhance handler implementations to better process and report exceptions
4. **Comprehensive Exception Capture**: Ensure all exceptions are properly caught and handled

### Monitoring
1. **Exception Rates**: Track how often exceptions are handled
2. **Handler Performance**: Measure the time taken to process exceptions
3. **Exception Types**: Monitor the types of exceptions being handled
4. **Handler Usage**: Track which components are using exception handlers
