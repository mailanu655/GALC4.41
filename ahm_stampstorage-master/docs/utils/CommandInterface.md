# CommandInterface

## Purpose
The CommandInterface defines constants and the contract for command objects in the StampStorage system. It establishes a standardized set of command codes and a common interface that command implementations must follow, enabling consistent command handling throughout the application.

## Logic/Functionality
- Defines constants for command values used throughout the system
- Establishes a default value for uninitialized commands
- Previously contained additional command codes that are now commented out
- Provides a contract that Command implementations must adhere to

## Flow
1. Command implementations implement this interface to gain access to the command constants
2. Command processors use these constants to identify and route commands
3. The constants serve as a centralized registry of valid command codes
4. New command types can be added by defining new constants in this interface

## Key Elements
- **DEFAULT_VALUE**: A constant (-1) representing an uninitialized or default command value
- **Commented Command Codes**: Previously defined command codes that are now commented out, suggesting they may have been moved elsewhere or are no longer used

## Usage
The interface is implemented by command classes and used by command processors:

```java
// Example of a class implementing the interface
public class Command implements CommandInterface, java.io.Serializable {
    // Implementation details
}
```

Command constants are used when creating and processing commands:

```java
// Example of using command constants
Command cmd = new Command(CommandInterface.DEFAULT_VALUE);
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Deprecated Command Codes**: The presence of commented-out command codes suggests potential code evolution
2. **Missing Command Definitions**: New command types may be used without being defined in the interface
3. **Duplicate Command Codes**: Command codes might be duplicated, leading to ambiguous command processing
4. **Interface Evolution**: As the system evolves, the interface may need to be updated to include new command codes

### Debugging Steps
1. **Review Command Usage**: Identify all places where commands are created and processed
2. **Check Command Codes**: Verify that all command codes used in the application are defined in the interface
3. **Examine Commented Code**: Evaluate whether the commented-out command codes should be restored or removed
4. **Audit Command Processing**: Ensure that command processing logic correctly handles all defined command codes

### Resolution
1. **Interface Updates**: Add new command codes to the interface as needed
2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove commented-out code if it's no longer needed
3. **Documentation Improvements**: Enhance documentation to clarify the purpose and usage of each command code
4. **Command Validation**: Implement validation to ensure only defined command codes are used

### Monitoring
1. **Command Usage**: Track which command codes are used most frequently
2. **Error Rates**: Monitor for exceptions related to undefined or invalid command codes
3. **Interface Changes**: Track changes to the interface over time to understand how command usage evolves
4. **Command Processing Performance**: Measure the time taken to process different types of commands
