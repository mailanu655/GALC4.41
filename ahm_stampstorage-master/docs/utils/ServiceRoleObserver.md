# ServiceRoleObserver

## Purpose
The ServiceRoleObserver interface defines a contract for components that need to be notified of service role changes in the StampStorage system. It enables a consistent way for components to respond when a service transitions between active and passive roles, supporting the high-availability architecture of the system.

## Logic/Functionality
- Defines a single method for handling role change notifications
- Enables components to react to service role transitions
- Supports the observer pattern for role change events
- Promotes loose coupling between the role management system and components that need to respond to role changes

## Flow
1. Components that need to respond to role changes implement this interface
2. These components register themselves with the ServiceRoleWrapper
3. When a role change occurs, the ServiceRoleWrapper calls the roleChange method on all registered observers
4. Each observer responds to the role change according to its specific requirements

## Key Elements
- **roleChange Method**: The core method that takes a boolean parameter indicating whether the service is now in passive mode

## Usage
The interface is implemented by components that need to respond to role changes:

```java
// Example of a class implementing the interface
public class StampServiceServerSocket implements Runnable, StampServiceServerSocketInterface, ServiceRoleObserver {
    @Override
    public void roleChange(boolean isPassive) {
        if (isPassive) {
            closeAndWait();
        }
    }
    
    // Other methods...
}
```

These components register themselves with the ServiceRoleWrapper:

```java
// Example of registering as an observer
ServiceRoleWrapper serviceRoleWrapper = ServiceRoleWrapperImpl.getInstance();
serviceRoleWrapper.addObserver(this);
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Registration**: Observers not properly registered with the ServiceRoleWrapper
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: Observers not fully implementing the required behavior for role changes
3. **Exception Handling**: Exceptions in one observer affecting notifications to other observers
4. **Timing Issues**: Race conditions between role changes and observer notifications

### Debugging Steps
1. **Check Observer Registration**: Verify that observers are properly registered with the ServiceRoleWrapper
2. **Review Implementation Logic**: Ensure that observers correctly implement the roleChange method
3. **Test Role Transitions**: Test both active-to-passive and passive-to-active transitions
4. **Monitor Notification Flow**: Trace the flow of notifications to ensure all observers are being notified
5. **Examine Exception Handling**: Check how exceptions in observers are handled during notifications

### Resolution
1. **Registration Verification**: Add logging or validation to ensure observers are properly registered
2. **Implementation Improvements**: Enhance observer implementations to handle role changes correctly
3. **Exception Handling**: Improve exception handling during observer notifications
4. **Synchronization**: Add appropriate synchronization to prevent race conditions

### Monitoring
1. **Role Change Events**: Track when role changes occur and which observers are notified
2. **Observer Response Times**: Measure how long it takes for observers to process role changes
3. **Exception Rates**: Monitor for exceptions during observer notifications
4. **Observer Count**: Track the number of registered observers
