# ServiceRoleWrapper

## Purpose
The ServiceRoleWrapper interface defines a contract for managing service roles in the StampStorage system. It provides methods for controlling and querying the active/passive state of services, managing role observers, and handling the initialization and configuration of role-based behavior. This interface is central to the high-availability architecture of the system.

## Logic/Functionality
- Defines methods for checking and setting the passive/active state of a service
- Provides observer management for role change notifications
- Includes methods for accessing the CountDownLatch used for thread coordination
- Supports initialization and configuration of role-based behavior
- Extends Runnable to enable execution in a dedicated thread

## Flow
1. The service role wrapper is initialized with configuration settings
2. Components register as observers to be notified of role changes
3. The wrapper determines the initial role (active or passive) based on configuration
4. When a role change occurs, all registered observers are notified
5. The CountDownLatch is used to coordinate threads waiting for role changes
6. The wrapper continues to monitor and manage the service role throughout the system lifecycle

## Key Elements
- **Role State Methods**: isPassive() and setPassive() for checking and setting the service role
- **Observer Management**: addObserver() and removeObserver() for managing role change observers
- **Latch Access**: getLatch() for accessing the CountDownLatch used for thread coordination
- **Initialization**: init() for initializing the wrapper with configuration settings
- **Configuration**: setSocketProperties() for setting socket-related properties

## Usage
The ServiceRoleWrapper is typically accessed as a singleton and used to manage service roles:

```java
// Example of accessing the wrapper
ServiceRoleWrapper roleWrapper = ServiceRoleWrapperImpl.getInstance();

// Example of checking the service role
if (roleWrapper.isPassive()) {
    // Handle passive mode
} else {
    // Handle active mode
}

// Example of registering an observer
roleWrapper.addObserver(new ServiceRoleObserver() {
    @Override
    public void roleChange(boolean isPassive) {
        // Respond to role change
    }
});

// Example of waiting at the latch
roleWrapper.getLatch().await();
```

## Debugging and Production Support

### Common Issues
1. **Role Synchronization**: Services might have inconsistent views of the current role
2. **Observer Notification**: Observers might not be properly notified of role changes
3. **Latch Management**: Issues with the CountDownLatch could cause threads to hang
4. **Configuration Problems**: Incorrect configuration could lead to improper role determination
5. **Concurrency Issues**: Race conditions in role changes and observer notifications

### Debugging Steps
1. **Check Role State**: Verify that all components have a consistent view of the current role
2. **Review Observer Registration**: Ensure that observers are properly registered and notified
3. **Inspect Latch State**: Check the state of the CountDownLatch to ensure it's being properly managed
4. **Examine Configuration**: Review the configuration settings that affect role determination
5. **Analyze Thread Behavior**: Look for potential race conditions or deadlocks related to role changes

### Resolution
1. **Synchronization Improvements**: Enhance synchronization to ensure consistent role views
2. **Observer Handling**: Improve observer registration and notification
3. **Latch Management**: Ensure proper management of the CountDownLatch
4. **Configuration Validation**: Add validation for configuration settings
5. **Concurrency Fixes**: Address race conditions and potential deadlocks

### Monitoring
1. **Role Change Events**: Track when role changes occur and why
2. **Observer Notifications**: Monitor the flow of observer notifications
3. **Thread States**: Track the states of threads waiting on the latch
4. **Configuration Changes**: Log changes to configuration settings
5. **Error Rates**: Monitor for exceptions related to role management
